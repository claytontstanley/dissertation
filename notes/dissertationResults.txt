Experiment 1: Prior Activation
- Optimal d close to .5; a bit higher; for both datasets
- Robust effect; independent of follower count, number of tweets, reputation, number of questions asked
- High accuracy even when only prior is used; shows importance of prior
- Effect of turning on OL:
	for both types of OL; prob less accurate
	d is also lower, closer to .5 (interesting since OL is the default in ACT-R)
