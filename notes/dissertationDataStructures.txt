Try to stay entirely in R.
- Use TM package for data mining (chunking, lemmetization)
- Use RPostGreSQL package to store persistant db objects
	Also use to store and access initial SO data
- data.table package for munging
- rjson to import tweet data

May need Python for
- tweepy to grab Python data in json format
	Then most likely load into R via rjson and then into postgres for persistance
