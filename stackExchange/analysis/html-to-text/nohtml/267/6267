I'm so tired of not having tabbed browsing when navigating through windows explorer.
I've tried a few solutions in the past, but what I really want is just an extension/addon/plugin/something that lets me browse my file system with tabs.
Does anyone have any good solutions that they have found to do this? Alternatively, I'm willing to just code it myself, but I don't even know where to begin... Is there any way to legally modify/customize the windows explorer? What language, how do I get started?
I can already visualize the replies "no, you're screwed, switch to linux" (which doesn't have tabbed browsing either by the way)...
