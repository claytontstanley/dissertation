Have you used OpenID in anger?
I'm going to be using OpenID for authentication on my site.  Which provider should I recommend to my users?
I'm thinking, based on the feedback that the OpenID auth is getting on StackOverflow, that I'd want to recommend one that does attribute exchange properly. So: who's that?
