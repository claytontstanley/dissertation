I've been tasked (by my wife) with creating a program to allow her to track the family trees on both sides of our family.
Does anyone know of a cost effective (free) control to represent this type of information.
What I'm looking for is a modified org-chart type chart/tree. The modification is that any node should have 2 parent nodes (E.G. a child should have a Mother/Father).
The solution I've came up with so far is to have 2 trees, an ancestor tree and a descendants tree, with the individual being inspected as the root node for each tree. It works, but is sort of clunky.
I'm working primarily in c# WinForms, so .Net type controls or source code is preferrable.
Thanks.
