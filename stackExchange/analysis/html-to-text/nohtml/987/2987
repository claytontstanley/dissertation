I am writing an application that needs to bring window of an external app to the foreground, and not necessarily steal focus (there is a setting the user can toggle to steal/not steal focus).
What is the best way to go about this using the win32 API? I have tried SetForeground() but it always steals focus and does not consistenly work.
What is the best way to go about this? Any thoughts?
