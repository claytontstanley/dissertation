We have just had a graduate join the team with the end aim of assisting out our very busy DBA.
He has only a basic SQL knowledge from his degree so we are looking for a really good getting started book preferably based on MS SQL server.
Purchase Update: Thanks to the replies we have now purchased Head First SQL to review what he already knows and Beginning SQL Server 2005 Programming to enhance these skills.
Further down the page you can see my full review of the books for our needs. However still feel free to post more books as others may find them useful!
