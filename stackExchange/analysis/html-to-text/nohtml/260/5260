I have a situation where I want to add hours to a date and have the new date wrap around the work-day. I cobbled up a function to determine this new date, but want to make sure that I'm not forgetting anything.
The hours to be added is called "delay". It could easily be a parameter to the function instead.
Please post any suggestions. [VB.NET Warning]
Private Function GetDateRequired() As Date     ''// A decimal representation of the current hour     Dim hours As Decimal = Decimal.Parse(Date.Now.Hour) + (Decimal.Parse(Date.Now.Minute) / 60.0)       Dim delay As Decimal = 3.0           ''// delay in hours     Dim endOfDay As Decimal = 12.0 + 5.0 ''// end of day, in hours     Dim startOfDay As Decimal = 8.0      ''// start of day, in hours      Dim newHour As Integer     Dim newMinute As Integer      Dim dateRequired As Date = Now     Dim delta As Decimal = hours + delay      ''// Wrap around to the next day, if necessary     If delta > endOfDay Then         delta = delta - endOfDay         dateRequired = dateRequired.AddDays(1)          newHour = Integer.Parse(Decimal.Truncate(delta))         newMinute = Integer.Parse(Decimal.Truncate((delta - newHour) * 60))         newHour = startOfDay + newHour     Else         newHour = Integer.Parse(Decimal.Truncate(delta))         newMinute = Integer.Parse(Decimal.Truncate((delta - newHour) * 60))     End If      dateRequired = New Date(dateRequired.Year, dateRequired.Month, dateRequired.Day, newHour, newMinute, 0)      Return dateRequired End Sub
Note: This will probably not work if delay is more than 9 hours long. It should never change from 3, through.
EDIT: The goal is find the date and time that you get as a result of adding several hours to the current time. This is used to determine a default value for a due date of a submission. I want to add 3 hours to the current time to get the due date time. However, I don't want due dates that go beyond 5pm on the current day. So, I tried to have the hours split between (today, up to 5pm) and (tomorrow, from 8am on), such that adding 3 hours to 4pm would give you 19am, because 1 hour is added to the end of today and 2 hours are added to the beginning of tomorrow.
