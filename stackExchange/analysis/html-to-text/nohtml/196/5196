I've been lucky enough to have been employed for a while now but face the prospect of a job search in the next month or so.
I know Monster and CareerBuilder are wasted cesspools for head-hunters, scammers and spammers, so where is a good place to spend time posting a resume and reading serious listings?
If it helps, I'm a not-quite-senior level dev looking for something product focused rather than consulting.
