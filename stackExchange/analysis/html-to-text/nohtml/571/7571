What are the recommended online or offline resources for Objective-C and Cocoa programming?
My online resources:
O'Reilly , Some useful articles and examples, but has not been updated for quite a while
Learning Objective C , This seems like a good resource so far
Late Night Cocoa Podcast , I recently discovered this one, starting on episode 1
My offline resources:
None, I have no books on my shelf
I need some help finding a good book, any suggestions?
