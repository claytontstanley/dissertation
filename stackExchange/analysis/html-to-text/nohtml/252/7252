We have a junior programmer that simply doesn't write enough tests.
I have to nag him every two hours, "have you written tests?"
We've tried:
Showing that the design becomes simpler
Showing it prevents defects
Making it an ego thing saying only bad programmers don't
This weekend 2 team members had to come to work because his code had a NULL reference and he didn't test it
My work requires top quality stable code, and usually everyone 'gets it' and there's no need to push tests through. We know we can make him write tests, but we all know the useful tests are those written when you're into it.
Do you know of more motivations?
