And what is your system of choice?
Off the top of my head I would say that for a real one step web 'build' the following steps would have take place:
Take a source snapshot
Change any config files for release
Compress CSS and JS
Run Tests
Take a database snapshot [without test data]
Move the source to the server
Import a clean, current version of the database into the server
Automatically confirm the 'build' was successful
Has anyone got a system that does all of these steps?
