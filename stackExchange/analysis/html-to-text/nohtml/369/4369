I have a directory structure like the following;
/script.php
/inc/include1.php
/inc/include2.php
/objects/object1.php
/objects/object2.php
/soap/soap.php
Now, I use those objects in both script.php and /soap/soap.php, I could move them, but I want the directory structure like that for a different reason. When executing script.php the include path is inc/include.php and when executing /soap/soap.php it's ../inc, absolute paths work, /mnt/webdev/[project name]/inc/include1.php... But it's an ugly solution if I ever move the directory to a different location.
So is there a way to use relative paths, or a way to programically generate the "/mnt/webdev/[project name]/"?
