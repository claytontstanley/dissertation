I can't seem to find Developer Express' version of the LinkButton.  (The Windows Forms linkbutton, not the ASP.NET linkbutton.)  HyperLinkEdit doesn't seem to be what I'm looking for since it looks like a TextEdit/TextBox.
Anyone know what their version of it is?  I'm using the latest DevX controls: 8.2.1.
Thanks. JK
