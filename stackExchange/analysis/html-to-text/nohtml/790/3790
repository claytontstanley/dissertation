I've been working on a project that accesses the WMI to get information about the software installed on a user's machine. We've been querying Win32_Product only to find that it doesn't exist in 64-bit versions of Windows because it's an "optional component" .
I know there are a lot of really good alternatives to querying the WMI for this information, but I've got a bit of a vested interest in finding out how well this is going to work out.
What I want to know is if there's some kind of redistributable that can be packaged with our software to allow 64-bit users to get the WMI Installer Provider put onto their machines? Right now, they have to install it manually and the installation requires they have their Windows disc handy.
Thanks, everyone.
Edit:
You didn't mention for what OS, but the WMI Redistributable Components version 1.0 definitely exists.
For Operation System, we've been using .NET 3.5 so we need packages that will work on XP64 and 64bit versions of Windows Vista.
