I'm not sure what the correct size should be.
Many sites seem to repeat that the apple-touch-icon should be 57x57 pixels but cite a broken link as their source.
Hanselman 's and playgroundblues 's comments suggest different sizes including 163x163 and 60x60.
Apple's own apple.com icon is 129x129!
See my related question: How do I give my web sites an icon for iPhone?
