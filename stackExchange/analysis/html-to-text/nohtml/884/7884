I've just come across this in a WHERE clause:
AND NOT (t.id = @id)
How does this compare with:
AND t.id != @id
Or with:
AND t.id <> @id
I'd always write the latter myself, but clearly someone else thinks differently. Is one going to perform any better than the other? I know that using <> or != is going to bust any hopes for using an index that I might have had, but surely the first approach above will suffer the same problem?
