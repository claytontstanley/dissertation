Alright, this is a rather odd question that doesn't have one true answer:
What is the * Best || Easiest to Use || Most Powerful || Cleanest * GUI API or library (tk, SWING, Qt, etc.) you have had the privilege to use?
I've had conversations with friends about how annoying XYZ API was to deal with and how someone could build a better one, and I was curious what other's thoughts were on the subject.  Is there a good and straightforward way to implement a GUI from the programmer's standpoint, and has someone done it yet?
