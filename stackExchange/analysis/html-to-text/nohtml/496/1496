For those of us that like to use the graphical version of Vim or Emacs, instead of the console version, which version do you recommend?
For Vim, there's Mac OS X Vim , MacVim , Vim-Cocoa .
For Emacs, CarbonEmacs , XEmacs , and Aquamacs .
Are there more? Which of these are ready for prime-time? If it's a tough call, what are the trade-offs? Are all of these still being maintained?
No discussion of Vim vs. Emacs, if you don't mind, or comparisons with other editors.
