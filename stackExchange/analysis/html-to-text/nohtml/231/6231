Jeff Atwood is often expounding the benefits of triple monitor setups for developers, and I have to say I agree with him.  However, we are about to take on a good number of new developers and are hoping to kit them out with a nice development environment.
I was wondering, if given the opportunity, what you people would think of as the perfect setup - One, two, three, or perhaps even four monitors!  Try not to think about what you would like to have in order to show off (or play Warcraft on!) but rather, what do you think would offer the peak performance increase for your development activities.
