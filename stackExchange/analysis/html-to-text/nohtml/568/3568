I'm a mid/seniorish level developer myself. I've interviewed many junior level developers, fresh out of college looking for their first job. So I've read up on things like Joel's Guerrilla Guide to interviewing - http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html and I agree that it's a great way to structure that in-person meeting.
A lot of the stuff in there seems more geared towards junior devs just getting started in their careers. Asking the guys to sketch out some code, for example. Is this kind of stuff relevant for when interviewing a Senior developer? Would it be insulting to ask these kinds of questions to somebody who boasts building entire Enterprise systems on his resume?
