At what point does a MySQL database start to lose performance?
Does physical database size matter?
Do number of records matter?
Is any performance degradation linear or exponential?
Ive got (what I believe to be) a large database, almost 2GB and about 15M records. Should I be cleaning this out, or am I OK for another few years?
