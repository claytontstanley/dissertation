I'm currently experimenting with build script, and since I have an ASP.net Web Part under source control, my build script should do that at the end:
Grab the "naked" Windows 2003 IIS VMWare or Virtual PC Image from the Network
Boot it up
Copy the Files from the Build Folder to the Server
Install it
Do whatever else is needed
I have never tried automating a Virtual Machine, but I saw that both VMWare and Virtual Server offer automation facilities. While I cannot use Virtual Server (Windows XP Home :-(), Virtual PC works.
Does anyone here have experience with either VMWare Server or Virtual PC 2007 SP1 in terms of automation?
Which one is better suited (I run windows, so the Platform-independence of VMWare does not count) and easier to automate?
