We have a php project that we would like to version control. Right now there are three of us working on a "Dev" version of the project that all have our Eclipse linked to it with just an external folder, and thus no version control.
What is the right way, and what is the best way, to version control this (not necessarily the same I dont think)
We have a SVN set up but just need to find a good way to check in and check out that lets us test on the dev server. Any ideas?
