This is how I wanted to do it which would work in PHP 5.3.0+
<?php     class MyClass     {         const CONSTANT = 'Const var';             }      $classname = 'MyClass';     echo $classname::CONSTANT; // As of PHP 5.3.0 ?>
But I'm restricted to using PHP 5.2.6. Can anyone think of a simple way to simulate this behaviour without instantiating the class?
