I have a fairly simple ASP.NET 2.0 menu control using a sitemap file and security trimmings. There are only 21 menu options, but the results HTML of the menu is a whopping 14k. The site is hosted on our company's intranet and must be serverd to people worldwide on limited bandwidth, so I'd like to reduce the size of the menus.
What is the best way to do this? Does anybody have a good reference? I have the following constraints:
The solution cannot reference any 3rd part DLL files (getting approval would be a nightmare)
Must work with IE 6
CSS and JavaScript are fine, as long as they work with IE 6.
