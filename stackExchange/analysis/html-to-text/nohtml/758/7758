I'm getting all learned up about binding in WPF.  I'm having a lot of trouble debugging the parse errors in my xaml, though.  Can somebody pretty please tell me what's wrong with this little piece? :
<Border Name="TrackBackground"                     Margin="0"                     CornerRadius="2"                                          Grid.Row="1"                     Grid.Column="1"                     Background="BlanchedAlmond"                     BorderThickness="1"                     Height="{TemplateBinding Height}"> <Canvas Name="PART_Track" Background="DarkSalmon" Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="1"> <Thumb Name="ThumbKnob" Height="{Binding ElementName=Part_Track, Path=Height, Mode=OneWay}" /> </Canvas> </Border>
It's the databinding that breaks.  I get an InvalidAttributeValue exception for ThumbKnob.Height when I try to run this.  I know I must be missing something fundamental.  So fill me in, stackers, and my gratitude will be boundless.
