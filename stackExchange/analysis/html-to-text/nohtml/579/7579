In the SSW rules to better SQL Server Database there is an example of a full database maintenance plan: SSW . In the example they run both a Reorganize Index and then a Rebuild Index and then Update Statistics. Is there any point to this? I thought Reorganize Index was a fast but less effective version of Rebuild Index? and that an index rebuild would also update the statistics automatically (on the clustered index at least).
