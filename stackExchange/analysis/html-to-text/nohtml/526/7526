I will probably start with C and then Lisp. Although I started programming in C, I did not program in it as much as I want. It's fun working with the low level stuff. Learning C helped me a lot when I started working. I've only started learning Lisp now and I found it amazing that the concepts it supported from the very start are still very relevant today. Well I think it's better late than never.
