I've seen the MF people talk and have heard my own fair share of MF evangelism, yet haven't done anything about it fearing the gains aren't really worth the hassle. Does anyone use this?
BTW, from their website :
"microformats are a set of simple, open data formats built upon existing and widely adopted standards. Instead of throwing away what works today, microformats intend to solve simpler problems first by adapting to current behaviors and usage patterns (e.g. XHTML, blogging)."
