In an application that heavily relies on .htaccess RewriteRules for its PrettyURLs (CakePHP in my case), how do I correctly set up directives to exclude certain directories from this rewriting? I.e.:
/appRoot/.htaccess
app/
static/
By default every request to /appRoot/* is being rewritten to be picked up by app/webroot/index.php, where it's being analysed and corresponding controller actions are being invoked. This is done by these directives in .htaccess:
RewriteBase /appRoot
RewriteRule ^$ app/webroot/     [L]
RewriteRule (.*) app/webroot/$1 [L]
I now want to exclude a few directories like static/ from this rewriting. I tried with this before the Cake RewriteRules:
RewriteCond $1 ^(static|otherDir).*$ [NC]
RewriteRule (.*) - [L]
It works in so far that requests are no longer rewritten, but now all requests are being skipped, even legitimate Cake requests which should not match ^(static|otherDir).*$.
I tried several variations of these rules but can't get it to work the way I want.
