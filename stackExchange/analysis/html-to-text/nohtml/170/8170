I'm trying to find a well written understandable tutorial for beginners trying to use the windows command prompt.  I'm working with one such beginner and they keep calling me with questions about commands, and I want a concise tutorial or reference to send them to.
I tried google, with many combinations of the likely search terms, and got nothing but garbage.  There's a lot of documents out there, but none of them are what I'd call good.
Does anyone happen to know of a great tutorial for how to use the windows command prompt?
( This is the best I found so far , but the page style is horrible -- you have to turn off the stylesheet in your browser for this one.)
Thanks to Brad for the distinction between DOS and Windows Commmand Line, duly noted.
To those offering up command references, thank you.  What I really need is more of a tutorial than a reference: the beginner probably doesn't know what command he is looking for, so the reference is less useful
