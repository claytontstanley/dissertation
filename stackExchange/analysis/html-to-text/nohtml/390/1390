I'm setting up a dedicated SQL Server 2005 box on Windows Server 2008 this week, and would like to pare it down to be as barebones as possible while still being fully functional.
To that end, the "Server Core" option sounds appealing, but I'm not clear about whether or not I can run SQL Server on that SKU.  Several services are addressed on the Microsoft website , but I don't see any indication about SQL Server.
Does anyone know definitively?
