Should the folders in a solution match the namespace?
In one of my teams projects, we have a class library that has many sub-folders in the project.
Project Name and Namespace: MyCompany.Project.Section
Within this project, there are several folders that match the namespace section: - Folder Vehicles has classes in the MyCompany.Project.Section.Vehicles namespace - Folder Clothing has classes in the MyCompany.Project.Section.Clothing namespace - etc.
Inside this same project, is another rogue folder - Folder BusinessObjects has classes in the MyCompany.Project.Section namespace
There are a few cases like this where folders are made for "organizational convenience".
My question is: What's the standard?  In class libraries do the folders usually match the namespace structure or is it a mixed bag?
Thanks!
