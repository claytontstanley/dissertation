Recently I've been playing with an Arduino board as one of my hobbies, I'm having lots of fun with it and I'd like to get into circuits etc in a much bigger way. I've done a lot of research on various avenues I could go down, but I'm sure some of you guys know which books/sites are best.
I'm comfortable in c++ and c# , I know there's a board that you can write c# code for (also see the net Micro Framework ) and most chips use c, please feel free to answer any number of the following questions.
1) What are the best books/sites for someone looking to break into writing for microcontrollers, eg I've heard avrFreaks has lots of info (Most important question)
2) Is it true that for the majority of controllers C is the only choice? No OO possible?
3) Is there any emulation software that would give me a virtual microcontroller and let me try out code with different components etc connected to the controller, so I don't have to buy them to play with em?
4) I live in england, what sites do you know of that have a wide range of parts/good prices for components etc?
It seems like other users have interest in this as well, so I'm hoping someone in the know notices this. Thanks in advance !
