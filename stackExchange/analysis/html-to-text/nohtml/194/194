Yes, I know.  The existence of a running copy of SQL Server 6.5 in 2008 is absurd.
That stipulated, what is the best way to migrate from 6.5 to 2005?  Is there any direct path?  Most of the documentation I've found deals with upgrading 6.5 to 7.
Should I forget about the native SQL Server upgrade utilities, script out all of the objects and data, and try to recreate from scratch?
I was going to attempt the upgrade this weekend, but server issues pushed it back till next.  So, any ideas would be welcomed during the course of the week.
Update.  This is how I ended up doing it:
Back up the database in question and Master on 6.5.
Execute SQL Server 2000's instcat.sql against 6.5's Master.  This allows SQL Server 2000's OLEDB provider to connect to 6.5.
Use SQL Server 2000's standalone "Import and Export Data" to create a DTS package, using OLEDB to connect to 6.5.  This successfully copied all 6.5's tables to a new 2005 database (also using OLEDB).
Use 6.5's Enterprise Manager to script out all of the database's indexes and triggers to a .sql file.
Execute that .sql file against the new copy of the database, in 2005's Management Studio.
Use 6.5's Enterprise Manager to script out all of the stored procedures.
Execute that .sql file against the 2005 database.  Several dozen sprocs had issues making them incompatible with 2005.  Mainly non-ANSI joins and quoted identifier issues.
Corrected all of those issues and re-executed the .sql file.
Recreated the 6.5's logins in 2005 and gave them appropriate permissions.
There was a bit of rinse/repeat when correcting the stored procedures (there were hundreds of them to correct), but the upgrade went great otherwise.
Being able to use Management Studio instead of Query Analyzer and Enterprise Manager 6.5 is such an amazing difference.  A few report queries that took 20-30 seconds on the 6.5 database are now running in 1-2 seconds, without any modification, new indexes, or anything.  I didn't expect that kind of immediate improvement.
