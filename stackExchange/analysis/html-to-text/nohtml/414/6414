In a C# (feel free to answer for other languages) loop, what's the difference between break and continue as a means to leave the structure of the loop, and go to the next iteration?
Example:
foreach (DataRow row in myTable.Rows)
{
if (someConditionEvalsToTrue)
{
break; //what's the difference between this and continue ?
//continue;
}
}
