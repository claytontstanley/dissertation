I'm using subclipse in Flex Builder 3, and recently received this error when trying to commit:
svn: Checksum mismatch for '/Users/redacted/Documents/Flex Builder 3/path/to/my/file.mxml'; expected: 'f8cb275de72776657406154dd3c10348', actual: 'null'
I worked around it by:
Committing all the other changed files, omitting the troublesome one.
Copying the contents of the trouble file to a TextMate window
Deleting my project in FlexBuilder/Eclipse
Checking my project out fresh from SVN
Copying the text of the trouble file back in from the TextMate Window
Committing the changes.
It worked, but I can't help but think there's a better way. What's actaully happening to cause the svn:checksum error, and what's the best fix.
Maybe more important -- is this a symptom of a greater problem?
