I've seen a number of places recently that offer online HTML API documentation and also offer downloadable (usually .chm) help files.
I really love using .chm help files, mainly because of the index tree on the left.
What are the best tools for creating those types of files?  Is there something that would allow me to have a bunch of HTML files that can be put online and also compiled into a .chm?
edit (expanding the scope of my original question)
All of the tools below look interesting, especially sandcastle which I'm downloading now.
Are there any command-line tools for Linux that do this?
