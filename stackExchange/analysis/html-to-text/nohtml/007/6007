How do I make Log4net only log Info level logs? Is that even possible? Can you only set a threshold?
This is what i have, and it logs Info and above as i would expect. Is there anything i can do to make it only log info.
<logger name="BrokerCollection.Model.XmlDocumentCreationTask">
<appender-ref ref="SubmissionAppender"/>
<level value="Info" />
</logger>
