Anyone have any advice for finding good small software companies to work for? I've found that they rarely seem to advertise job openings, or basically will wait for someone to come to them...which I get since they are small are obviously wouldn't be that way if they were hiring a lot. I'm talking about some place a lot like Joel's FogCreek...there's just no way I'm moving to NYC. And specifically, does anyone know of any in the Carolina's?
