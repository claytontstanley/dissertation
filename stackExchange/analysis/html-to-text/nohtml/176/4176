So far, my favorite programming language has been python, hands down, but I've been hearing a number of good things about ruby from various people I hold in good regard, so let me put it to you:
Why should I learn Ruby?
Please do not post something to the effect of "Because it is awesome" or "It's better than language X because..." I don't want a war on my hands. I'm looking for concrete examples of what makes Ruby a useful language to code in.
