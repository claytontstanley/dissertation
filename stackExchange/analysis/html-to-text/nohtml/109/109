Recently our site has been deluged with the resurgence of the ASPRox bot SQL Injection attack. Without going into details, the attack attempts to execute SQL code by encoding the T-SQL commands in an ASCII encoded BINARY string. It looks something like this:
DECLARE%20@S%20NVARCHAR(4000);SET%20@S=CAST(0x44004500...06F007200%20AS%20NVARCHAR(4000));EXEC(@S);--
I was able to decode this in SQL, but I was a little wary of doing this since I didn't know exactly what was happening at the time.
I tried to write a simple decode tool so I could decode this type of text without even touching SQL server. The main part I need decoded is:
CAST(0x44004500...06F007200 AS NVARCHAR(4000))
I've tried all of the following commands with no luck:
txtDecodedText.Text =      System.Web.HttpUtility.UrlDecode(txtURLText.Text);              txtDecodedText.Text =     Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));     txtDecodedText.Text =     Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));              txtDecodedText.Text =     Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));     txtDecodedText.Text =     Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Convert.FromBase64String(txtURLText.Text));
Can anybody suggest the proper way to translate this encoding without using SQL Server. Is is possible? I'll take VB.net code since I'm familiar with that too.
