I have come across a lot of optimization tips which say that you should mark your classes as sealed to get extra performance benefits.
I ran some tests to check the performance differential and found none. Am I doing something wrong? Am I missing the case where sealed classes will give better results?
Has anyone run tests and seen a difference?
Help me learn :)
