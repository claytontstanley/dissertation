What is the best approach to write hooks for Subversion in Windows? As far as I know, only executable files can be used. So what is the best choice?
Plain batch files (very limited but perhaps OK for very simple solutions)
Dedicated compiled executable applications (sledgehammer to crack a nutshell?)
Some other hybrid choice (like a batch file running a Powershell script)
