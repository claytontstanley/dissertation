I am interested in learning how to write Flash programs, but I'm not ready to shell out the big bucks for Flash CS3 Professional.  What's the best compromise between affordability and education?
Edit: @sparkes: Given that this is for personal education only, and not something I'm likely to use for professional purposes anytime soon, I'm very unlikely to spend the $400 on the full version of CS3.
I'll clarify my question: What is the best alternative to CS3 for developing Flash applications?
