I haven't seen any questions relating to GNU autoconf/automake builds, but I'm hoping at least some of you out there are familiar with it.  Here goes:
I have a project (I'll call it myproject) that includes another project (vendor).  The vendor project is a standalone project maintained by someone else.  Including a project like this is fairly straightforward , but in this case there is a tiny snag: each project generates its own config.h file, each of which defines standard macros such as PACKAGE, VERSION, etc.  This means that, during the build, when vendor is being built, I get lots of errors like this:
... warning: "VERSION" redefined ... warning: this is the location of the previous definition ... warning: "PACKAGE" redefined ... warning: this is the location of the previous definition
These are just warnings, for the time being at least, but I would like to get rid of them.  The only relevant information I've been able to turn up with a google search is this thread on the automake mailing list, which isn't a whole lot of help.  Does anybody else have any better ideas?
