I am displaying a list of items using a SAP ABAP column tree model, basically a tree of folder and files, with columns. I want to load the sub-nodes of folders dynamically, so I'm using the EXPAND_NO_CHILDREN event which is firing correctly. Unfortunately, after I add the new nodes and items to the tree, the folder is automatically collapsing again, requiring a second click to view the sub-nodes. Do I need to call a method when handling the event so that the folder stays open, or am I doing something else wrong?
* Set up event handling.   LS_EVENT-EVENTID  = CL_ITEM_TREE_CONTROL=>EVENTID_EXPAND_NO_CHILDREN.   LS_EVENT-APPL_EVENT = GC_X.   APPEND LS_EVENT TO LT_EVENTS.

SET HANDLER GO_APPLICATION->HANDLE_EXPAND_NO_CHILDREN     FOR GO_MODEL.  ...   * Add new data to tree.
