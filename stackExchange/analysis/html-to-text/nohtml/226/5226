I am currently in the process of creating my own blog and I have got to marking up the comments, but what is the best way to mark it up?
The information I need to present is:
Persons Name
Gravatar Icon
Comment Date
The Comment
Any idea's would be much appriciated.
PS: I'm only interested in semantic html markup.
