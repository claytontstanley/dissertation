Before reading anything else, please take time to read the original thread.
A quick simple overview:  A .xfdl file is a is a gzipped .xml file which has then been encoded in base64.  I wish to de-encode the .xfdl into xml which I can then modify and then re-encode back into a .xfdl file.
xfdl > xml.gz > xml > xml.gz > xfdl
I have been able to take a .xfdl file and de-encode it from base64 using uudeview:
uudeview -i yourform.xfdl
Then decommpressed it using gunzip
gunzip -S "" < UNKNOWN.001 > yourform-unpacked.xml
The xml produced is 100% readable and looks wonderful.  Without modifying the xml then, i should be able to re-compress it using gzip:
gzip yourform-unpacked.xml
Then re-encoded in base-64:
base64 -e yourform-unpacked.xml.gz yourform_reencoded.xfdl
If my thinking is correct, the original file and the re-encoded file should be equal.  If I put yourform.xfdl and yourform_reencoded.xfdl into beyond compare, however, they do not match up.  Also, the original file can be viewed in an .xfdl viewer.  The viewer says that the re-encoded xfdl is unreadable.
I have also tried uuenview to re-encode in base64, it also produces the same results. Any help would be appreciated.
