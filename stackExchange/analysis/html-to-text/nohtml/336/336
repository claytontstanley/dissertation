So I hear a lot of opinions about this, and I wanted to see if there was anything resembling a consensus. When is it appropriate to use an unsigned variable over a signed one? What about in a for loop?
for (unsigned int i = 0; i < someThing.length(); i++) {
SomeThing var = someThing.at(i);
// You get the idea.
}
As I said, I hear a lot of opinions, but not a lot of consensus. I know Java doesn't have unsigned values, and that must have been a concious decision on Sun's part.
Looking forward to hearing everybody's opinion.
