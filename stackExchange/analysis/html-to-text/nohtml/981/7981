I'm working on bringing some old code from 1998 up to the 21st century.  One of the first steps in the process is converting the printf statements to QString variables.  No matter how many times I look back at printf though, I always end up forgetting one thing or the other.  So, for fun, let's decode it together, for ole' times sake and in the process create the first little 'printf primer' for Stackoverflow.
In the code, I came across this little gem,
printf("%4u\t%016.1f\t%04X\t%02X\t%1c\t%1c\t%4s", a, b, c, d, e, f, g);
How will the variables a, b, c, d, e, f, g be formatted?
