Hi,
I'm suddenly back to WinForms, after years of web development, and am having trouble  with something that should be simple.  I have an ArrayList of business objects bound to a  Windows Forms DataGrid.  I'd like the user to be able to edit the cells, and when finished,  press a Save button.  At that point I'd like to iterate the all the rows and columns in the  DataGrid to find any changes, and save them to the database.  But I can't find a way to  access the DataGrid rows.
I'll also want to validate individual cells real time, as they are edited, but I'm pretty  sure that can be done.  (Maybe not with an ArrayList as the DataSource?)  But as for iterating the DataGrid, I'm quite surprised it doesn't seem possible.
Must I really stuff my business objects data into datatables in order to use the
datagrid?
Thanks,
Mike
