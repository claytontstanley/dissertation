My organization has a form to allow users to update their email address with us. It's suggested that we have two input boxes for email: the second as an email confirmation.
I always copy/paste my email address when faced with the confirmation. I'm assuming most of our users are not so savvy.
Regardless, is this considered a good practice? I can't stand it personally, but I also realize it probably isn't meant for me. If someone screws up their email, they can't login, and they must call to sort things out.
