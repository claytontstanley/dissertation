I'm thinking of trying Beautiful Soup, a python package for HTML scraping.  Are there any other HTML scraping packages I should be looking at?  Python is not a requirement, I'm actually interested in hearing about other languages as well.
The story so far:
Python
Beautiful Soup
lxml
HTQL
Ruby
Nokogiri
Hpricot
Mechanize
scrAPI
scRUBYt!
.NET
Html Agility Pack
WaitiN
Perl
WWW::Mechanize
Web-Scraper
Java
Tag Soup
HtmlUnit
PHP
htmlSQL
Most of them
Screen-Scraper
Update: If you want to see a scraper app, check out Grant's SO user page monitor .  Nifty!
