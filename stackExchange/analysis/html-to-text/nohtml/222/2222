I'm currently working on an application with a frontend written in Adobe Flex 3. I'm aware of FlexUnit but what I'd really like is a unit test runner for Ant/NAnt and a runner that integrates with the Flex Builder IDE (AKA Eclipse). Does one exist?
Also, are there any other resources on how to do Flex development "the right way" besides the Cairngorm microarchitecture example?
Edit: Thanks for the great replies. Unfortunately SO will only let me accept one answer, so due to reasons of not having tried either approach yet, I decided to accept the one that came first. Upmods for both, though. :)
