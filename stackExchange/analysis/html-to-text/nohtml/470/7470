After a couple hours fighting with the Gallery2 RSS module and getting only the message, "no feeds have yet been defined", I gave up.  Based on a Google search for "no feeds have yet been defined" , this is a pretty common problem.  Do you have any tips and/or tricks for getting the Gallery2 RSS module to work?  Or any tips for a relatively-PHP-ignorant developer trying to debug problems with this PHP application?
