I have tried (in vain) to convince my team that we should use Project Planning Software. I see it as a great way to plan out our projects and determine deadlines for deliverables. They see it as a hindrance to productivity.
Is there some grand arguement that I'm missing here? I would absolutely love to see how long we planned for Milestone X, then how much time it took to complete Milestone X. That information is invaluable to me. But, they just don't see the value.
