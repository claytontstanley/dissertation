We recently discovered that the Google Maps API does not play nicely with SSL.  Fair enough, but what are some options for overcoming this that others have used effectively?
Will the Maps API work over SSL (HTTPS)?
At this time, the Maps API is not   available over a secure (SSL)   connection. If you are running the   Maps API on a secure site, the browser   may warn the user about non-secure   objects on the screen.
We have considered the following options
Splitting the page so that credit card collection (the requirement for SSL) is not on the same page as the Google Map.
Switching to another map provider, such as Virtual Earth.  Rumor has it that they support SSL.
Playing tricks with IFRAMEs.  Sounds kludgy.
Proxying the calls to Google.  Sounds like a lot of overhead.
Are there other options, or does anyone have insight into the options that we have considered?
