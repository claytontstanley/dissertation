Is it "acceptable" to have an ASP.Net 2.0 application without the BLL (Business Logic Layer) as the following?
SQL Server Data Storage & Stored Procedures
Data Link Layer (Strongly Typed Table Adapters) connecting to Stored Procs
Presentation Layer ASPX Pages with Code behind and ObjectDataSource for connection straight to the DLL
Is a BLL always preferable, even if business logic is entirely validatable in the presentation's code behind?  What are the potential drawbacks for not using a BLL?
