Something I've run into posting on SO: when you refer to a function with arguments, what is the best way to typeset it for readibility, brevity, and accuracy? I tend to put empty parentheses after the function name like func(), even if there are actually arguments for the function. I have trouble including the arguments and still feeling like the paragraph is readable.
Any thoughts on best practices for this?
