Using MAPI functions from within managed code is officially unsupported. Apparently, MAPI uses its own memory management and it crashes and burns within managed code (see here and here )
All I want to do is launch the default e-mail client with subject, body, AND one or more attachments.
So I've been looking into MAPISendDocuments and it seems to work. But I haven't been able to gather courage to actually use the function in production code.
Has anybody used this function a lot? Do you have any horror stories?
PS. No, I won't shellExecute Outlook.exe with command line arguments for attachments.
PPS. Attachment support is a requirement , so Mailto: solutions do not cut it for me.
