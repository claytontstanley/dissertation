Similar but different to Keyboard for programmers , simply put, what keyboard layout is the best?
I'm using Colemak and it's good but I don't think it's actually faster than Qwerty . Dvorak was certainly (for me anyway) not very fast at all. I have however found that Colemak is not so strain-inducing as Qwerty.
