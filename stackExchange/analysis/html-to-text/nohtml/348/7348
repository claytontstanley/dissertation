My requirements:
Support .NET Compact Framework 2.0 and Windows Mobile 6.0 devices.
Only need to unzip the contents to a directory on a storage card. Creation of zip files is not required.
Must be able to use in corporate/commercial software.
Can be open source, but not have GPL or other viral license.
I've seen the Xceed Zip for CF library. What other options are there?
