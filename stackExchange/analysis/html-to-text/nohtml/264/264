This isn't a question, just more seeking expert advice.
What's the optimal level of concurrency that the C++ implementation of BerkeleyDB can reasonably support?  How many threads can I have hammering away at the DB before throughput starts to suffer because of resource contention?  I've read the manual and know how to set the number of locks, lockers, database page size, etc., but I'd just like some advice from someone who has real-world experience with BDB concurrency.
My application is pretty simple, I'll be doing gets and puts of records that are about 1kb each.  No cursors, no deleting.
