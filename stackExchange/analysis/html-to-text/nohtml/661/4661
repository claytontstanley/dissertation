I have more than one OpenID as I have tried out numerous.  As people take up OpenID different suppliers are going to emerge I may want to switch provinders.  As all IDs are me, and all are authenticated against the same email address, shouldn't I be able to log into stack overflow with any of them and be able to hit the same account?
