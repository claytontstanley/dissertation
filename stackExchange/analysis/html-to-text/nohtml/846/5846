How do I turn the following 2 queries into 1 query
$sql = "SELECT level FROM skills WHERE id = $id LIMIT 1;"; $result  = $db->sql_query($sql); $level  = (int) $db->sql_fetchfield('level'); $db->sql_freeresult($result);  ++$level;  $sql = "UPDATE skills SET level = $level WHERE id = $id;"; $result = $db->sql_query($sql); $db->sql_freeresult($result);
I'm using it in a phbBB mod but the gist is that I grab the level, add one to it then update, it seems that it'd be much easier and faster if I could do it as one query.
Edit: $id has already been forced to be an integer, thus no escaping is needed this time.
