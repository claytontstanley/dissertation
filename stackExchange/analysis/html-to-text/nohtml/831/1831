For years I have been trying to find an organizational scheme which works for me.
I've tried digital calendars ( Google Calendar , My WebCal at work, Chandler , Sunbird ) to no avail as of yet.  I've played around with Remember the Milk (which is a pretty cool app in and of itself...) but I never quite got in the groove of actually using it and checking it. I've even done the _**physical**_ calendar thing (the horror). Maybe the best scheme I've found (which during the summer has gone to rot) is a wall of color-coded sticky notes... organized colorful chaos if you will.  Oh I do get things done (appointments, projects, etc.)... but it would be nice to actually have things layed out in a cleaner fashion.  Then I wouldn't have to worry so much about if I've forgotten something.
The Question:
How do people organize their life, their work, their software projects?  Do you use software, some physical scheme, or what?  Are people actually organized?
I guess the tie-in to software development is:  I think I'd have more brain cycles available to get things coded if I had to spend less keeping everything else in order.  I do think this is as, or even more important than, having a good monitor, keyboard, and chair.  So what say you the people?
