I'm using the .NETCF (Windows Mobile) Graphics class and the DrawString() method to render a single character to the screen.  The problem is that I can't seem to get it centered properly.  No matter what I set for the Y coordinate of the location of the string render, it always comes out lower than that and the larger the text size the greater the Y offset.  For example, at text size 12, the offset is about 4, but at 32 the offset is about 10.  I want the character to vertically take up most of the rectangle it's being drawn in and be centered horizontally. Here's my basic code.  "this" is referencing the user control it's being drawn in.
Graphics g = this.CreateGraphics();          float padx = ((float)this.Size.Width) * (0.05F);         float pady = ((float)this.Size.Height) * (0.05F);          float width = ((float)this.Size.Width) - 2 * padx;         float height = ((float)this.Size.Height) - 2 * pady;          float emSize = height;          g.DrawString(letter, new Font(FontFamily.GenericSansSerif, emSize, FontStyle.Regular),             new SolidBrush(Color.Black), padx, pady);
Yes, I know there is the label control that I could use instead and set the centering with that, but I actually do need to do this manually with the Graphics class.
