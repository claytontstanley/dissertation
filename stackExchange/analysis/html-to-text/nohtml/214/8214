How are you instrumenting your UI's? In the past I've read that people have instrumented their user interfaces, but what I haven't found is examples or tips on how to instrument a UI.
By instrumenting, I mean collecting data regarding usage and performance of the system. A MSDN article on Instrumentation is http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x5952w0c.aspx . I would like to capture which buttons users click on, what keyboard shortucts they use, what terms they use to search, etc.
How are you instrumenting your UI?
What format are you storing the instrumentation?
How are you processing the instrumented data?
How are you keeping your UI code clean with this instrumentation logic?
Specifically, I am implementing my UI in WPF, so this will provide extra challenges compared to instrumenting a web-based application. (i.e. need to transfer the instrumented data back to a central location, etc). That said, I feel the technology may provide an easier implementation of instrumentation via concepts like attached properties.
Have you instrumented a WPF application? Do you have any tips on how this can be achieved?
