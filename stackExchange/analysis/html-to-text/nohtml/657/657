What is the fastest, yet secure way to encrypt passwords in (PHP Prefered), and for which ever method you choose is it portable?
In other words if I later migrate my website to a different server will my passwords continue to work?
The method I am using now I was told is dependent on the exact versions of the libraries installed on the server.
