If I have a javascript associative array say:
var myArray = new Object(); myArray["firstname"] = "Gareth"; myArray["lastname"] = "Simpson"; myArray["age"] = 21;
Is there a built in or accepted best practice way to get the length of this array?
EDIT: JavaScript does not have associative arrays -- it only has objects.
