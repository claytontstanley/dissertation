We've finally moved our websites to a decent host , and for the first time we have Shell Access.
I know very little about using Linux, I can navigate through the file system, read files with Vim and I'm aware of the man command, and I have been able to work out solutions to problems as they show up (eventually), but I know I'm unaware of a lot.
Edit: We currently only use the host to hold our live sites, I'm sure that we use it more effectively, but I'm not sure where to start.
So with Web Development in mind:
What are the essential commands that every Linux user should know about?
What are the most useful commands that I should look into?
