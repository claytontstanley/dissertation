In my web application I have a file which hold the current revision number via $Rev$. This work fine except, if I don't make any changes to that file, it doesn't get committed.
Is there anyway I can force a single file to always get committed to the SVN server?
I'm using TortoiseSVN for Windows so any code or step-by-step instructions would be helpful.
