I've played with CVS a little bit and am not the most familiar with all of its capabilities, but a huge annoyance for me is trying to add new directories that contain more directories in them. Running "cvs add" only adds the contents of the current directory, and using "cvs import" didn't look like the right thing either since it's still all code I'm producing (this howto claimed import is for 3rd party sources )
Do you guys know any way to recursively add everything in a given directory to the current CVS project (or if SVN or git makes this notably easier)?
