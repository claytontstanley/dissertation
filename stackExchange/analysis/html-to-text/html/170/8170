<p>I'm trying to find a well written understandable tutorial for beginners trying to use the windows command prompt.  I'm working with one such beginner and they keep calling me with questions about commands, and I want a concise tutorial or reference to send them to.</p>

<p>I tried google, with many combinations of the likely search terms, and got nothing but garbage.  There's a lot of documents out there, but none of them are what I'd call <em>good</em>.</p>

<p>Does anyone happen to know of a great tutorial for how to use the windows command prompt?</p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.animatedsoftware.com/faqs/learndos.htm" rel="nofollow" title="Cocoa Programming for Mac OSX">This is the best I found so far</a>, but the page style is horrible -- you have to turn off the stylesheet in your browser for this one.)</p>

<p><em>Thanks to Brad for the distinction between DOS and Windows Commmand Line, duly noted</em>.  </p>

<p><em>To those offering up command references, thank you.  What I <strong>really need</strong> is more of a tutorial than a reference: the beginner probably doesn't know what command he is looking for, so the reference is less useful</em></p>
