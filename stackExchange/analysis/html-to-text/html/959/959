<p>Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to attend several conferences. Some were OK, but most of time, I feel like I could have learned a lot more from reading a book or 2. The worst example was VSLive. It cost my company several thousand dollars to send me and I feel like I came away with virtually no new information. At a recent Visual Studio "launch event", one of the speakers did a quick poll and determined that most people were attending for the free software (we got a copy of Visual Studio) or to get a day off work.  Are IT conferences useful or a waste of time?</p>
