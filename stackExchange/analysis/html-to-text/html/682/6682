<p>I 'm currently investigating the different styles of AOP in Java and I started with AspectJ. I try to get a good view on the different styles:</p>

<ul>
<li>weaver</li>
<li>proxy</li>
<li>any others</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you know a good tutorial or technology article about the different frameworks and techniques?</p>
