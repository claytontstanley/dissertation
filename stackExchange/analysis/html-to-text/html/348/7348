<p>My requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support .NET Compact Framework 2.0 and Windows Mobile 6.0 devices.</li>
<li>Only need to unzip the contents to a directory on a storage card. Creation of zip files is not required.</li>
<li>Must be able to use in corporate/commercial software.</li>
<li>Can be open source, but not have GPL or other viral license.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've seen the <a href="http://xceed.com/Zip_NET_CF_Intro.html" rel="nofollow" title="Reading List: Fog Creek Software Management Training Program">Xceed Zip for CF</a> library. What other options are there?</p>
