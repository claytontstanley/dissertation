<P>Jeff mentioned the <A href="http://colemak.com/" rel="nofollow">Colemak keyboard layout</A> on Twitter. Seems pretty cool - most of the benefits of Dvorak, but a much less drastic change from the standard QWERTY layout. For instance, control-z, control-x, control-c, and control-v all stay the same.</P>
<P>Anyone tried it?</P>
