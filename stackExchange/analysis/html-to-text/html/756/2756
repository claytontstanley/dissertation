<p>Even though I have a robust and fast computer (Pentium Dual Core 2.0 with 2Gb RAM), I'm always searching for lightweight software to have on it, so it runs fast even when many apps are up and running simultaneously.</p>

<p>On the last few weeks I've been migrating gradually to Linux and want to install a free lightweight yet useful IDE to program on C++ and PHP.  Sintax highlighting and code completition tips are must-haves.</p>

<p>So, I'd like to receive some suggestions from you, guys.</p>
