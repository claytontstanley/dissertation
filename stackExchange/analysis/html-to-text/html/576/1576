<p>We've finally moved our websites to a decent <a href="http://www.simplehelix.com/" rel="nofollow">host</a>, and for the first time we have Shell Access.</p>

<p>I know very little about using Linux, I can navigate through the file system, read files with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim%5F%28text%5Feditor%29" rel="nofollow">Vim</a> and I'm aware of the man command, and I have been able to work out solutions to problems as they show up (eventually), but I know I'm unaware of a lot.</p>

<p>Edit: We currently only use the host to hold our live sites, I'm sure that we use it more effectively, but I'm not sure where to start.</p>

<p>So with Web Development in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are the essential commands that every Linux user should know about?</li>
<li>What are the most useful commands that I should look into?</li>
</ul>
