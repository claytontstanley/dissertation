<p>I'd like to contribute to open source but I'm not a professional programmer. I contributed an extra function to a PHP project once, but on submission it was rewritten and, in hindsight, the functionality was completely useless anyway. I was actively encouraged by the project members who were very supportive but I can't help feeling I was generating more work than was necessary for them.</p>

<p>I suppose the question is - Are novice programmers a hindrance to a project?</p>
