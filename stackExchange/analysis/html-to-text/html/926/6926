<p>I want to get started doing some game development using Microsoft's XNA. Part of that is Shader development, but I have no idea how to get started. I know that <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/fx_composer_home.html" rel="nofollow">nVidia's FX Composer</a> is a great tool to develop shaders, but I did not find much useful and updated content on how to actually get started.</p>

<p>What tutorials would you recommend?</p>
