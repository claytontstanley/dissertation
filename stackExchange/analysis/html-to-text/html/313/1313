<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/180/function-for-creating-color-wheels" rel="nofollow">Original Question</a></p>

<p>I am looking for a function that attempts to quantify how "distant" (or distinct) two colors are. This question is really in two parts: </p>

<ol>
<li>What color space best represents human vision?</li>
<li>What distance metric in that space best represents human vision (euclidean?)</li>
</ol>
