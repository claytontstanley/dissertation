<p>I am currently creating a master ddl for our database.  Historically we have used backup/restore to version our database, and not maintained any ddl scripts.  The schema is quite large.</p>

<p>My current thinking:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Break script into parts (possibly in separate scripts):</p>

<ol>
<li>table creation</li>
<li>add indexes</li>
<li>add triggers</li>
<li>add constraints</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Each script would get called by the master script.</p></li>
<li>I might need a script to drop constraints temporarily for testing</li>
<li>There may be orphaned tables in the schema, I plan to identify suspect tables.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any other advice?</p>

<p>Edit: Also if anyone knows good tools to automate part of the process, we're using MS SQL 2000 (old, I know).</p>
