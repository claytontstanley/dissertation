<p>I was watching a couple of episodes of dnr.tv and was given my first glimpse of ReSharper, I was very impressed so I decided to give it a try, fully aware that it'd take some getting used to, but is it worth depending on this dependency? Also I learn best by following tutorials first then experimenting, is there a good tutorial for ReSharper <strong>4</strong> that I've missed on my googling?</p>

<p><strong>Info gathered from answers</strong>
So far I'd already found these, but they might be useful for others</p>

<p><strong>Useful links</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm pretty sure this is not written about the latest version of reSharper, so I can't be sure how much of this transfers over to using 4.0
