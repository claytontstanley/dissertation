<p>What is the best documentation generator?  I want to something that will easily add templates for documenting functions, classes, etc.  I know there are several tools out there -- from Visual Studio plugins to external applications that take code files as input.</p>

<ul>
<li>which is the best?  (If language-specific, specify)</li>
<li>are there any documentation tools that could be used for multiple
languages (e.g. VB.net and
JavaScript)</li>
</ul>

<p>Bonus points if they're free / open source.</p>
