<p>Similar but different to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/687/keyboard-for-programmers" rel="nofollow">Keyboard for programmers</a>, simply put, what keyboard layout is the best?</p>

<p>I'm using <a href="http://colemak.com/" rel="nofollow">Colemak</a> and it's good but I don't think it's actually faster than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY" rel="nofollow">Qwerty</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard" rel="nofollow">Dvorak</a> was certainly (for me anyway) not very fast at all. I have however found that Colemak is not so strain-inducing as Qwerty.</p>
