<p>Is there a way to get MS virtual PC 2007 to support multiple displays? Or is there another virtual machine product available that will allow me to work with multiple displays?</p>

<p>At the company I work for we do all of our development in virtual machines.
We currently use MS Virtual PC 2007 for this. I would love to be able to spread my machine's display across multiple displays, but I don't know of any way to do this. Any advice would be appreciated.</p>
