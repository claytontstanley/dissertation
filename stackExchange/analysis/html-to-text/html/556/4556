<p>Which of the following has the best performance?</p>

<p>I have seen method two implemented in JavaScript with huge performance gains, however, I was unable to measure any gain in C# and was wondering if the compiler already does method 2 even when written like method 1.</p>

<p>The theory behind method 2 is that the code doesn't have to access DataTable.Rows.Count on every iteration, it can simple access the int c.</p>

<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; DataTable.Rows.Count; i++) {
    // Do Something
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0, c = DataTable.Rows.Count; i &lt; c; i++) {
    // Do Something
}
</code></pre>
