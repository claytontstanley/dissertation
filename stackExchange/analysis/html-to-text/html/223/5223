<p>If I have a javascript associative array say:</p>

<pre><code>var myArray = new Object();
myArray["firstname"] = "Gareth";
myArray["lastname"] = "Simpson";
myArray["age"] = 21;
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a built in or accepted best practice way to get the length of this array?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: JavaScript does not have associative arrays -- it only has objects.</strong></p>
