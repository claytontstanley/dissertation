<p>I am a software engineer and I work for a small company, which means I have to do just about everything myself. So what is the best way to learn absolutely everything you need to know about SQL? Everything from the language, to managing databases, to programming to a database with C# 2.0 and what what version to use (free for commercial use is better, but not required).</p>
