<p>I'm aware of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/default.mspx" rel="nofollow">IE</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/" rel="nofollow">Safari</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/?from=getfirefox" rel="nofollow">Firefox</a> and <a href="http://www.opera.com/" rel="nofollow">Opera</a> but are there any other browsers out there that are worth knowing about? I've had several friends that don't like IE but then some of the above don't work on their computer either and I felt it'd be nice to have a few more alternatives.</p>
