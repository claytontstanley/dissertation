<p>I've really enjoyed <em>Apress Books Practical Projects</em> series.  I know that O'Reilly has a <em>Building a Web 2.0 Portal with ASP.NET</em> book and I have heard of a similar book for Cocoa programming (although I am not sure of its title.)  I'd like to know what other books or tutorials stackoverflow users would recommend that walks one through a project in any language or framework.  I'm familiar with the O'Reilly's Cookbook series as well but I'm more interested in something that describes an entire project or application.</p>
