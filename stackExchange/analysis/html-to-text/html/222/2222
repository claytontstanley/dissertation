<p>I'm currently working on an application with a frontend written in Adobe Flex 3. I'm aware of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/as3flexunitlib/" rel="nofollow" title="Bristol University Language Engineering Course">FlexUnit</a> but what I'd really like is a unit test runner for Ant/NAnt and a runner that integrates with the Flex Builder IDE (AKA Eclipse). Does one exist? </p>

<p>Also, are there any other resources on how to do Flex development "the right way" besides the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Cairngorm" rel="nofollow">Cairngorm microarchitecture</a> example?</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks for the great replies. Unfortunately SO will only let me accept one answer, so due to reasons of not having tried either approach yet, I decided to accept the one that came first. Upmods for both, though. :) </p>
