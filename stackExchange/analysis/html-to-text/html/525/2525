<p>My product is both ASP.NET, Windows forms app and Windows service. 
95% of code is .NET (VB if you must know).</p>

<p>For IP reasons, I need to obfuscate the code. I am using an old dotfuscator (over 5 years old) and thinking it is time to move to a new gen. Anyone can recommend from their personal experience (please don't just give me a list of vendors, I already have that) what works best for them? </p>

<p>Taking into account real life issues like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dealing with the old problem of serialization/de-serialization: Currently, I simply tell the tool <strong>not</strong> to obfuscate any class data members. The pain of not being able to load data that was previously serialized with an old version is just to big</li>
<li>Integrating the tool into the build process?</li>
<li>Working with ASP.NET which is a story since depending on the settings, you don't always have the same dll names (and you have lots of them, one per page), and not all tools handle this well.</li>
</ul>
