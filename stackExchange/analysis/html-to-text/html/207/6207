<P>Has anyone had any experience in building a 'real world' application with the <A href="http://www.codeplex.com/smartclient" rel="nofollow">Smart Client Software Factory</A>, from Microsofts Patterns and Practices group? I'm looking for advice on how difficult it was to master, whether it decreased your time to market and any other general pitfalls.</P>
