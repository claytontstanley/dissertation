<p>I currently use a datatable to get results from a database which I can use in my code.</p>

<p>However, many example on the web show using a dataset instead and accessing the table(s) through the collections method.</p>

<p>Is there any advantage, performance wise or otherwise, of using datasets or datatables as a storage method for sql results?</p>
