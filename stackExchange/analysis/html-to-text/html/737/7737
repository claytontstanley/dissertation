<p>Is there a good way for displaying unicode text in opengl under Windows? For example, when you have to deal with different languages. The most common approach like</p>

<pre><code>#define FONTLISTRANGE 128
GLuint list;
list = glGenLists(FONTLISTRANGE);
wglUseFontBitmapsW(hDC, 0, FONTLISTRANGE, list);
</code></pre>

<p>just won't do because you can't create enough lists for all unicode characters.</p>
