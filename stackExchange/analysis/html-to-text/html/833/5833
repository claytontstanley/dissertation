<p>Any suggestions for a relatively simple, free, WYSIWYG, HTML editor? I have a friend in need of a art portfolio website and I want to her feet wet without forcing her to learn raw HTML or an overly complex (and probably expensive) program.</p>

<p>Extra points if somehow this free editor is OSS</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>sorry, still drinking my coffee</p>

<p>Windows-based, running locally
S
he knows enough to zip it up and get it to me. We'll save SFTP for a later date</p>

<p>This probably doesn't affect anything but, I will be hosting the site as well (LAMP setup)</p>
