<p>I'm trying to maintain a Setup Project in Visual Studio 2003 (yes, it's a legacy application). The problem we have at the moment is that we need to write registry entries to HKCU for every user on the computer. They need to be in the HKCU rather than HKLM because they are the default user settings, and do change per user. My feeling is that</p>

<ol>
<li>This isn't possible</li>
<li>This isn't something the installer should be doing, but something the application should be doing (after all what happens when a user profile is created after the install?).</li>
</ol>

<p>With that in mind, I still want to change as little as possible in the application, so my question is, <strong>is possible to add registry entries for every user in a Visual Studio 2003 setup project?</strong> </p>

<p>And, at the moment the project lists five registry root keys (HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, HKEY_CURRENT_USER, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, HKEY_USERS, and User/Machine Hive), I don't really know anything about the Users root key, and haven't seen User/Machine Hive. Can anyone enlighten me on what they are? Perhapes they could solve my problem above.</p>
