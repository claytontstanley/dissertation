<p>I need help finishing my custom built ajax [div] based dynamic dropdown. </p>

<p>Basically, I have an [input] box which; onkeyup, runs an Ajax search which returns a bunch of results in divs and are drawn back in using innerHTML. These divs all have highlights onmouseover so, a typical successfull search yields the following structure (pardon the semicode):</p>

<pre><code>[input]<br> [div id=results] //this gets overwritten contantly by my AJAX function<br>  [div id=result1 onmouseover=highlight onclick=input.value=result1]<br>  [div id=result2 onmouseover=highlight onclick=input.value=result2]<br>  [div id=result2 onmouseover=highlight onclick=input.value=result2]<br> [/div]<br></code></pre>

<p>It works.. beautifully! looks elegant and is way more complete than any regular dropdown (those results div bring in a lot of information).</p>

<p>However, I'm missing the most of important functions behind regular HTML elements, that is, I can't keyboard down or up between "options". How do I do this? I know javascript handles keyboard events but; I haven't been able to find a good guide on how to do this. (of course the follow up question to this will eventually end up being: "can I use  to trigger that onclick event)</p>

<p>Phew!</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
