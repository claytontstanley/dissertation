<p>Let me preface this question by saying I use TextMate on Mac OSX for my text needs and I am in love with it.  Anything comparable on the Linux platform?  I'll mostly use it for coding python/ruby.</p>

<p>Doing a google search yielded outdated answers.</p>

<p>Edit:  Since there has been some concern about the 'merit' of this question.  I am about to start a new Ruby Programming Project in Linux and before I got started I wanted to make sure I had the right tools to do the job.</p>

<p>Edit #2:  I use VIM on a daily basis -- all . the . time.  I enjoy using it.  I was just looking for some alternatives.</p>
