<p>I've recently been leaning towards the Apress books for my learning needs, though in the past I've used Wrox, Sams and o'reilly amongst others. I know this might just be personal preference but are certain publishers more/less stringent on quality? Do boks from certain publishers have a certain 'feel'?</p>

<p>Just curious as I'm a student so buying a Â£30 book is still a stop and think event.</p>
