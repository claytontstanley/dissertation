<p>How do I turn the following 2 queries into 1 query</p>

<pre><code>$sql = "SELECT level FROM skills WHERE id = $id LIMIT 1;";
$result  = $db-&gt;sql_query($sql);
$level  = (int) $db-&gt;sql_fetchfield('level');
$db-&gt;sql_freeresult($result);

++$level;

$sql = "UPDATE skills SET level = $level WHERE id = $id;";
$result = $db-&gt;sql_query($sql);
$db-&gt;sql_freeresult($result);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using it in a phbBB mod but the gist is that I grab the level, add one to it then update, it seems that it'd be much easier and faster if I could do it as one query.</p>

<p>Edit: $id has already been forced to be an integer, thus no escaping is needed this time.</p>
