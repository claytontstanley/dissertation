<p>I'm wondering if it's a good idea to make <strong>verifications</strong> in <strong>getters</strong> and <strong>setters</strong> or elsewhere in the code.</p>

<p>This might surprise you be when it comes to <strong>optimizations</strong> and <strong>speed-ing</strong> up the code, I think you should not made verifications in getters and setters but in the code where your're <strong>updating</strong> your files or database. Am I wrong ?</p>
