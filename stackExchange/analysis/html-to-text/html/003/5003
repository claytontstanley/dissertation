<p>I see so many people using their laptops on the plane.</p>

<p>Half of them watch movies/listen to music/use it for entertainment.</p>

<p>But then there's the other half that has spreadsheets/documents/planners/productivity software opened up. I can't help but wonder how do they get anything done in such an uncomfortable environment? </p>

<p><em>Note: I'm talking about Economic class, Business class can be a comfortable place to use a laptop</em></p>

<p><strong>Is flight-time productive for you?</strong></p>
