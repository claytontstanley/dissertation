<p>Hi guys!
As anyone ever assisted the CSLA Master Class from Rockford Lhotka? (<a href="http://www.dunntraining.com/training/cslamasterclass.htm" rel="nofollow">www</a>).
<br><br>
It seems a good way to enforce my OO knowledge in the asp.net field, but since I have to consider the flight to Atlanta and the course's price ($ 2.500), I'm not convinced yet. <br>
<br>
Also, I could barrely find any feedback on the web.<br><br>
Could anyone share some experience or comments?<br><br>
Thanks a lot. </p>
