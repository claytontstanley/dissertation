<P>I need to display a map of the U.S. with states shown in different colors according to underlying data. I'd also like to have this map contain some facility for subscribing to hover/click events on each state in javascript, presumably using an imagemap.</P>
<P>The data won't be changing in any kind of AJAX-y way, so ideally this component would generate a static image that would be cacheable.</P>
<P>Any suggestions?</P>
