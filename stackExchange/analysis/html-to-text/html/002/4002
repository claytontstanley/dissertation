<p>How do you practice coding?  I've seen the great <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/" rel="nofollow">CodeKata</a> and also <a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/practicing-programming" rel="nofollow">Steve Yegge's Practicing Programming</a>.</p>

<p>What are some more interesting exercises?</p>
