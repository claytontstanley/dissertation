<p>I've been lucky enough to have been employed for a while now but face the prospect of a job search in the next month or so.</p>

<p>I know Monster and CareerBuilder are wasted cesspools for head-hunters, scammers and spammers, so where is a good place to spend time posting a resume and reading serious listings? </p>

<p>If it helps, I'm a not-quite-senior level dev looking for something product focused rather than consulting.</p>
