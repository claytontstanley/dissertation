<p>In your opinion, what's the best technical conference for developers? What conferences have you attended, and what did you like about them/not like about them? 
I attended MS TechEd this year and learned a fair amount, but I'm interested in alternatives.<br>
<strong>Edit:</strong> I'm mostly interested in .net technologies, but I'd like to hear about other technologies' conferences and what's been good/not good about them so I know more about what to look for.</p>
