<p>Given a string like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a,"string, with",various,"values, and some",quoted</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is a good algorithm to split this based on commas while ignoring the commas inside the quoted sections?</p>

<p>The output should be an array:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[ "a", "string, with", "various", "values, and some", "quoted" ]</p>
</blockquote>
