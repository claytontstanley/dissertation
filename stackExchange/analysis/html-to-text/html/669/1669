<p><em>Preferred Languages</em> : <code>C/C++, Java, and Ruby</code></p>

<p>I am looking for some helpful books/tutorials on how to write your own compiler simply for educational purposes. I am most familiar with <code>C/C++, Java, and Ruby</code> so I prefer resources that involve one of those three, but any good resource is acceptable.</p>
