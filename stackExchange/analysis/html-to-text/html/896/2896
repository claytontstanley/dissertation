<p>I'd like suggestions for a small project to work on this fall. Something I can work on a few hours a week that will keep me entertained and help me learn new things about a particular language, coding style, etc.</p>

<p>I like to program in PHP and Java but am very interested in coding something using Python or Perl.  Any good ideas?</p>
