<p>Ok, heres one I've been saving for the day SO comes through.</p>

<p>Ive always been a Zend Studio user (PHP developer here, 5 years self taught). Just fairly recently Zend introduced an Eclipse version of Studio which, albeit a lot easier to install I keep hitting walls when it comes to setup, some things are just 20-click retarded (e.g. configuring an SFTP site).</p>

<p>Being I've seen Eclipse in use on a fairly large amount of programming languages, I know im surely missing the point, so. Questions: is it worth it? Are there any nicely written tutorials I can follow?</p>

<p>My dream IDE does highlighting and code completion for PHP, CSS and Javascript, any suggestions? ... For the mac?</p>

<p>Cheers, Thx.</p>
