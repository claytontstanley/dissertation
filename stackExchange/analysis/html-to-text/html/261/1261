<p>My company currently uses CVS as our defacto standard for source control.  I've heard many people say SVN is better, and I know that it's newer, but other than that am not sure of the benefits.  I should note we use primarily java and eclipse if that matters.  I guess what I'm looking for is a good, succinct comparison of the 2 noting advantages and disadvantes of using both in a java eclipse development environment?</p>
