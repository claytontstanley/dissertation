<P>I've got the task of displaying a web form to represent the properties in a .NET class. In WinForms, there's a pre-fab control named PropertyGrid that is a lot like what I need. I'm just looking for something to display a simple layout of property names next to an appropriate control like a textbox for strings or a dropdownlist for enum properties.</P>
<P>Does anything like this already exist for ASP.NET, or will I be rolling my own here?</P>
<P>thanks!</P>
