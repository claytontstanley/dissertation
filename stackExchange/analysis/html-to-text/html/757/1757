<p>I'm not trying to start controversy, but I'm wanting to know other's input on this sometimes touchy subject.  I've read all sorts of material about how you can find competent developers in India (and now sometimes China) who are just as good as their US counterparts, but at largely reduced rate.  Specifically I recently read <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0374292884" rel="nofollow">the world is flat</a> and he seems to argue in favor of competent, cheap offshore development.  From my personal experience working with offshore developers and with onshored contractors from India, they tend to be not very competent, slow to learn new material, and hard to work with due to cultural barriers.  Obviously this is a bit hand wavy, but that truly has been my experience.  </p>

<p>Please try to keep responses above board and well thought out, that is to say, lets not resort to broad generalizations, but I'd like to know what your thoughts and experiences on the subject are.</p>
