<p>Are advanced degrees such as Master's degrees or PhDs beneficial for software engineers? Should they be compensated for their advanced degree? There are plenty of programmers that don't have a degree that are better then programmers with advanced degrees so by which metric do you rate programmers? KLOC is not a good metric. For many areas of the hard sciences there is a vast difference in salary between the people with a B.S. and those with a Master's degree and a PhD. Should it be the same for software engineers? Why or why not?</p>
