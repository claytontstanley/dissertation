<P>For the past five years I've been using TDD where possible and I feel fairly comfortable and confident with the methodology.</P>
<P>I already know what mocking frameworks are used for but I'd like to learn more about how to use them. </P>
<P>Does anyone have a list of links to good examples of using mocking frameworks (including best practices, anti-patterns etc) in a real world business app. Can anyone recommend books on the topic? Any step by step tutorials?</P>
<P>Appreciated.</P>
<P><STRONG>Updated:</STRONG> Hah! just as I posted this someone else asked a similar question at the same time. </P>
