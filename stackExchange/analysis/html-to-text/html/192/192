<p>One of the fun parts of multi-cultural programming are numbers formats.</p>

<p>Americans use 10,000.50, Germans use 10.000,50, French use 10 000,50 etc.
My first approach would be: Take the string, parse it backwards, until I encounter a separator and use this as my decimal separator. The obvious flaw with that: 10.000 would be interpreted as 10.
Another approach: if the string contains 2 different non-numeric characters, use the last one as the decimal separator and discard the others. If I only have one, check if it occurs more than once and discard it if it does. It it only appears once, check if it has 3 digits after it. If yes, discard it, otherwise use it as decimal separator.</p>

<p>The obvious "best solution" would be to detect the User's culture or Browser, but that does not work if you have a Frenchman an an en-US Windows/Browser.</p>

<p>I just wonder: does the .net Framework contain some mythical black magic floating point parser that is better than Double.(Try)Parse() in trying to auto-detect the number format?</p>
