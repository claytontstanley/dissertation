<p>Is there a Windows equivalent of the Unix command, <em>nice</em>?</p>

<p>I'm specifically looking for something I can use at the command line, and <strong>not</strong> the "Set Priority" menu from the task manager.</p>

<p>My attempts at finding this on Google have been thwarted by those who can't come up with better adjectives.</p>
