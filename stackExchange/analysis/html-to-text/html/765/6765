<p>I'm going to start a new project - rewriting an existing system (PHP + SQL Server) from scratch because of some very serious limitations by design.</p>

<p>We have some quite good knowledge of SQL Server (currently we're using SQL Server 2000 in existing system) and we would like to employ its newer version (2008 I guess) in our new project.</p>

<p>I am really fond of technologies that Java offers - particularly Spring Framework and Wicket and I am quite familiar with Java from others projects and assignments before.
Therefore, we consider using Java and Microsoft SQL Server.</p>

<p>There are two JDBC drivers for SQL Server - jTDS and Microsoft's one - <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/aa937724.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/aa937724.aspx</a>. I think we should test both of them.<br/></p>

<p>Are there any limitations in such solution I should know of? Has someone experience with such a technology combination?</p>
