<p>I am in the process of figuring out a cache strategy for our current setup, currently have multiple web servers and wanted to know what is the best way to cache data in this environment. I have done research about MemCache and the native asp.net caching but wanted to get some feedback first. Should I go with a Linux box if I use MemCache or a win32 port of MemCache. Thanks!</p>
