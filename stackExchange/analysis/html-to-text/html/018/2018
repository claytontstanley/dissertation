<p><strong>Purchase Update:</strong> Thanks to the replies we have now purchased <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596526849/" rel="nofollow">Head First SQL</a> to review what he already knows and <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0764584332" rel="nofollow">Beginning SQL Server 2005 Programming</a> to enhance these skills.   </p>

<p><a href="#3754" rel="nofollow">Further down the page</a> you can see my full review of the books for our needs. However still feel free to post more books as others may find them useful!</p>
