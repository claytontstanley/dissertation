<p>When I used Metacity, I could drag windows between workspaces using the small icon view of my workspaces.  I recently started using Compiz for all the cool desktop effects, however this drag and drop feature isn't working.  I use the cube effect for switching workspaces, but I noticed the wall effect doesn't allow it either.</p>

<p>Is this just a missing feature from Compiz or is there a setting somewhere that I can enable it?  I know that I can enable dragging windows across edges to the next workspace, and the expose feature to drag windows between workspaces.  However, the drag and drop on the icon view is really powerful, and I would love to have it back along with all the great Compiz special effects.</p>
