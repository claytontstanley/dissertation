<p>So far I just use the SAP Developers' network at <a href="https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn" rel="nofollow">sdn.sap.com</a> but I would love something a bit more grassroots with bleeding-edge social features.</p>

<p>Blogs and forums and any opportunity to seek help and critique outside of my immediate team would be great...</p>
