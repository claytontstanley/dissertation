<p>I created a view on a machine using the <em>substring</em> function from Firebird, and it worked.  When I copied the database to a different machine, the view was broken.  This is the way I used it:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT SUBSTRING(field FROM 5 FOR 15) FROM table;<br></code></pre>

<p>And this is the output on the machine that does not accept the function:</p>

<pre><code>token unknown:  FROM<br></code></pre>

<p>Both computers have this configuration:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>IB Expert</em> version 2.5.0.42 to run the queries and deal with the database.</li>
<li><em>Firebird</em> version 1.5 as server to database.</li>
<li><em>BDE Administration</em> version 5.01 installed, with <em>Interbase</em> 4.0 drivers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any ideas about why it's behaving differently on these machines?</p>
