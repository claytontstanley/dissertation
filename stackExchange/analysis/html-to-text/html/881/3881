<p>I have a simple setter method for a Java property and null is not appropriate for this particular property.  I have always been torn, in this situation: should I throw an <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.html" rel="nofollow">IllegalArgumentException</a>, or a <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html" rel="nofollow">NullPointerException</a>?  From the javadocs, both seem appropriate.  Is there some kind of understood standard?  Or is this just one of those things that you should do whatever you prefer and both is really correct?</p>
