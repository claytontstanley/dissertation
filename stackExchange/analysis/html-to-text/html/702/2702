<p>I know I need to have (although I don't know why) an Order By clause on the end of a SQL query that uses any aggregate functions like count, sum, avg, etc:</p>

<pre><code>select count(userID), userName from users group by userName<br></code></pre>

<p>When else would GROUP BY be useful, and what are the performance ramifications?</p>
