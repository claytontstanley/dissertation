<p>Currently, I don't really have a good method of debugging javascript in internet explorer and safari. In Firefox, you can use Firebug's <a href="http://getfirebug.com/logging.html" rel="nofollow" title="Modern Compiler Implementation in ML">Logging feature</a> and <a href="http://getfirebug.com/commandline.html" rel="nofollow" title="Modern Compiler Implementation in Java">Command Line functions</a>. However, this doesn't help me when I move to other browsers.</p>
