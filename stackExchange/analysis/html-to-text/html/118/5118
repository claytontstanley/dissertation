<p>I'm working on a website which will switch to a new style on a set date. The site's built in semantic HTML and CSS, so the change should just require a CSS reference change. I'm working with a designer who will need to be able to see how it's looking, as well as a client who will need to be able to review content updates in the current look as well as design progress on the new look.</p>

<p>I'm planning to use a magic querystring value and / or a javascript link in the footer which writes out a cookie to select the new CSS page. We're working in ASP.NET 3.5. Any recommendations?</p>

<p>I should mention that we're using IE Conditional Comments for IE8,7,and 6 support. I may create a function that does a replacement:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link href="Style/&lt;% GetCssRoot() %&gt;.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;<br>&lt;!--[if lte IE 8]&gt;<br>    &lt;link type="text/css" href="Style/&lt;% GetCssRoot() %&gt;-ie8.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;<br>&lt;![endif]--&gt;<br>&lt;!--[if lte IE 7]&gt;<br>    &lt;link type="text/css" href="Style/&lt;% GetCssRoot() %&gt;-ie7.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;<br>&lt;![endif]--&gt;<br>&lt;!--[if lte IE 6]&gt;<br>    &lt;link type="text/css" href="Style/&lt;% GetCssRoot() %&gt;-ie6.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;<br>&lt;![endif]--&gt;<br></code></pre>
