<p>I had an PHP script to update the webserver from a local directory.
I'm migrating the script into Python, it works almost OK but after a PUT command the size of the file
in the server isn't the same as the local file. Once I download again the file from the FTP server,
the only difference is the CR/LF mark. It annoys me because the same script is comparing the size of the
files to update. Also, it works perfectly in PHP v√≠a ftp_put.</p>

<pre><code>from ftplib import FTP

ftpserver = "myserver"
ftpuser = "myuser"
ftppass = "mypwd"

locfile =  "g:/test/style.css"
ftpfile =  "/temp/style.css"

try:
    ftp = FTP(ftpserver, ftpuser, ftppass)
except:
    exit ("Cannot connect")

f = open (locfile, "r")
try:
    ftp.delete (ftpfile)
except:
    pass

# ftp.sendcmd ("TYPE I")
# ftp.storlines("STOR %s" % ftpfile, f)
ftp.storbinary("STOR %s" % ftpfile, f)
f.close()

ftp.dir (ftpfile)
ftp.quit()

<p>Any suggestions?</p>
