<p>Any suggestions for good, solid, bug tracking solutions that let me (and company members) document bugs in 1-or-2-click steps? Basically I grew tired of all the overhead Mantis brings in... </p>

<p>All I need is a list (do away with assign/status/priority/notes, phew! we're a small company!). I'm tempted to write it up in CakePHP, but before I do so, i'd love to know if there's something out there. Points if its free or web2-"ish".</p>

<p>Cheers, Thx.</p>
