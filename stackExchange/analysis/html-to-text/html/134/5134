<p>What is the best approach to write <strong>hooks</strong> for <strong>Subversion</strong> in <strong>Windows</strong>? As far as I know, only executable files can be used. So what is the best choice? </p>

<ul>
<li>Plain batch files (very limited but perhaps OK for very simple solutions)</li>
<li>Dedicated compiled executable applications (sledgehammer to crack a nutshell?)</li>
<li>Some other hybrid choice (like a batch file running a Powershell script)</li>
</ul>
