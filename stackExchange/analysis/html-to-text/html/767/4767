<p>Recently I've been playing with an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" rel="nofollow" title="Arduino Board">Arduino board</a> as one of my hobbies, I'm having lots of fun with it and I'd like to get into circuits etc in a much bigger way. I've done a lot of research on various avenues I could go down, but I'm sure some of you guys know which books/sites are best.</p>

<p>I'm comfortable in c++ and c# , I know there's a board that you can write c# code for (also see the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/embedded/bb267253.aspx" rel="nofollow" title=".net Micro Framework">net Micro Framework</a>) and most chips use c, please feel free to answer any number of the following questions.</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> What are the best books/sites for someone looking to break into writing for microcontrollers, eg I've heard <a href="http://www.avrfreaks.net/" rel="nofollow" title="AVR Freaks">avrFreaks</a> has lots of info <strong>(Most important question)</strong></p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> Is it true that for the majority of controllers C is the only choice? No OO possible?</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> Is there any emulation software that would give me a virtual microcontroller and let me try out code with different components etc connected to the controller, so I don't have to buy them to play with em?</p>

<p><strong>4)</strong> I live in england, what sites do you know of that have a wide range of parts/good prices for components etc?</p>

<p>It seems like other users have interest in this as well, so I'm hoping someone in the know notices this.
Thanks in advance !</p>
