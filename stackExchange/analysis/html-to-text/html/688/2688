<p>When you execute a SQL query, you have to clean your 'strings' or users can execute malicious SQL on your website.</p>

<p>I usually just have a function escape_string(blah), which:</p>

<ul>
<li>Replaces escapes () with double escapes (\).</li>
<li>Replaces single quotes (') with an escaped single quote (\'). </li>
</ul>

<p>Is this adequate? Is there a hole in my code? Speedy library to reliably do this for me?</p>

<p>I'd like to see graceful solutions in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>PHP</li>
</ul>
