<p>I'm looking for a good editor for both HTML and CSS. I currently use the Firebug Firefox extension, and this is a great tool, but I'm looking for something I can use without necessarily firing up a browser. Ideally it would have a live preview of what I'm coding.</p>

<p>Edit: As a student, I have access to MSDN. also, i have access to Windows, Mac, and Linux. So any platform will do.</p>
