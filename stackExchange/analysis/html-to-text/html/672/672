<p>Which build or configuration management tool are you using in your daily programmer's life? Which would you suggest and why? Are you going for <a href="http://ant.apache.org" rel="nofollow">Ant</a>? Do you use <a href="http://maven.apache.org" rel="nofollow">Maven</a>? Or is there an alternative out there, like <a href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/" rel="nofollow">Ivy</a> or <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/buildr/" rel="nofollow">Buildr</a>?</p>
