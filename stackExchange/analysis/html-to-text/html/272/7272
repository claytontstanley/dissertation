<p>Alright, so maybe I shouldn't have shrunk this question sooo much... I have seen the post on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/622/most-efficient-code-for-the-first-10000-prime-numbers" rel="nofollow">the most efficient way to find the first 10000 primes</a>.  I'm looking for <strong>all possible ways</strong>.  The goal is to have a one stop shop for primality tests.  Any and all tests people know for finding prime numbers are welcome.</p>

<p>And so:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What are all the different ways of finding primes?</strong></li>
</ul>
