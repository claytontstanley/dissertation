<p>I am using ASP.NET Dynamic Data for a project and I have a table that has two seperate fields that link to the same foreign key in a different table.</p>

<p>This relationship works fine in SQL Server.</p>

<p>However, in the LINQ to SQL model in the ASP.NET Dynamic Data model, only the first field's relationship is reflected.  If I attempt to add the second relationship manually, it complains that it "Cannot create an association "ForeignTable_BaseTable".  The same property is listed more than once: "Id"."</p>
