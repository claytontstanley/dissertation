<p>What is the best way to programmatically send an SMS text message?</p>

<p>Are there any free Web Service based SMS gateways?</p>

<p>I know that if I happen to know the user's carrier (Sprint, AT&amp;T, etc), I can send an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_gateways" rel="nofollow">SMS by emailing an address</a> based on phone number + carrier. I would like a good solution that does not require me to know the carrier. Barring that, is there an easy way to lookup carrier given a cell phone number?</p>

<p>I understand that there are some services independent of the major mobile carriers that offer a per-message fee-based service, with API. What I would like to know is how such organizations tap into the SMS networks. Do they have contracts with mobile carriers to resell their services?</p>
