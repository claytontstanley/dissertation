<P>I have a billion potential ideas running through my head. About five of those I have actually started and have become "side projects" in addition to my "day job". Some are further along than others, and a few are even demonstrable. The problem I have is that one always takes attention away from the others. I don't want to give up any of them, so the result is that none of them are finished.</P>
<P>Should I just pick the project with the most potential and finish it? Then how do I support it when I want to start something new? At what point should I form a "team" instead of going lone-wolf? Should I just quit and accept the fact that all my ideas can't succeed?</P>
<P><STRONG>Is there a (free) tool that will help me prioritize my projects and ideas, give me an overview of the status of each, and help me form a resonable time-table?</STRONG></P>
