<p>Besides the general, "What is OO?" question, I want to understand how one transitions from a procedural-based programmer to someone who <strong>gets OO</strong>.</p>

<p>I'm anticipating the winning answer would contain thoughts on SOLID, as well as some practices/drills for increasing our skills in design and development that fully leverages OO.  Books/classes/mentors also acceptable.</p>
