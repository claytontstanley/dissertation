<p>Lately I've been thinking a lot about the best way to enter an existing project fast.
I've written some of my thoughts <a href="http://codedump.wordpress.com/2008/07/31/software-project-learning-process/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and would really like to hear advice from other people. <br>
What are the things you find a must? <br>
I'm especially interested with open source projects, if there's any difference.</p>
