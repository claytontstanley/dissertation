<p>I was just sitting at my local Borders sipping coffee and reading (for free) 'More Joel on Software' when I came across Joel saying something about a particular type of programmer knowing the difference between an int and an Integer in Java/C# (Object Oriented Programming Languages).  After a quick 'brain check,' I realized, to my dismay, that I didn't know the answer.  Please help.</p>
