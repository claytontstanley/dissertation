<p>Getting Things Done is the thing these days. While the basic principle is only about keeping a TODO list, my main concern is maintaining this list.</p>

<p>I tried using e-mails, calendars, mind-mapping, bug trackers, text editor, notes, paper sheet.</p>

<p>My problem is that all these tools are, some part of the day, far from me. Far from the eye, far from the heart. I basically forget to use my GTD tool. Funny for a tool that is intended to remind me of everything.</p>

<p>Do you have any advice on a GTD tool (anything from software to little white rocks in the pocket) to can help me stay focus ON the tool ?</p>

<p>(Please provide <em>one</em> suggestion per answer.)</p>
