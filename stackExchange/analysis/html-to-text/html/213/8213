<p>I need to import a csv file into Firebird and I've spent a couple of hours trying out some tools and none fit my needs.</p>

<p>The main problem is that all the tools I've been trying like <a href="http://www.sqlmanager.net/products/ibfb/dataimport" rel="nofollow" title="Cocoa Programming for Mac OSX">EMS Data Import</a> and <a href="http://www.sqlmaestro.com/products/firebird/datawizard/help/06_01_05_csv/" rel="nofollow" title="Using Subversion hooks to send out build emails">Firebird Data Wizard</a> expect that my csv file contains all the information needed by my Table.</p>

<p>I need to write some custom SQL in the insert statement, for example, I have a cvs file with the city name, but as my database already has all the cities in another table (normalized), I need to write a subselect in the insert statement to lookup for the city and write its ID, also I have a stored procedure to cread GUIDS.</p>

<p>My Insert statement would be something like this:</p>

<p>INSERT INTO PERSON (ID, NAME, CITY<em>ID) VALUES((SELECT NEW</em>GUID FROM CREATE<em>GUID), :NAME, (SELECT CITY</em>ID FROM CITY WHERE NAME = :CITY_NAME)</p>

<p>I know that it is very easy to write an application to do this, but I don't like to reinvent the wheel, and I'm sure that there are some tools out there to do it.</p>

<p>Can you guys give me some advice?</p>
