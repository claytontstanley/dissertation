<p>I'm trying to track the progress of PHP 5.3 and PHP 6 and I occassionally see blogs posting information but there doesn't seem to be an authoritative source.  Does anybody know where there is an official summary of possible new features?</p>

<p>EDIT: There are some meeting notes that have been around for years... as far as I can tell this meeting has long since been superceded and nearly all of the other information out there is based entirely on that meeting.</p>

<p>I'm more looking for where the PHP developers themselves record the changes that they are currently making rather than the long-term vision.</p>
