<p>I've been doing bits and pieces of work in Lingo while helping a friend with some projects he's working on, but I haven't found any good resources for actually learning the language.  I'm sure I could pick up an old book somewhere that explains it, but I really just want a quick lesson and I think a website with some sample code and function reference would be perfect.</p>

<p>Does this exist?  My experience searching for lingo documentation in the past leads me to believe that it's just not on the web anywhere.</p>
