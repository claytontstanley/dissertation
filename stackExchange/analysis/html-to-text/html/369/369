<p>And what is your system of choice?</p>

<p>Off the top of my head I would say that for a real one step web 'build' the following steps would have take place:</p>

<ol>
<li>Take a source snapshot</li>
<li>Change any config files for release</li>
<li>Compress CSS and JS</li>
<li>Run Tests</li>
<li>Take a database snapshot [without test data]</li>
<li>Move the source to the server</li>
<li>Import a clean, current version of the database into the server</li>
<li>Automatically confirm the 'build' was successful</li>
</ol>

<p>Has anyone got a system that does all of these steps?</p>
