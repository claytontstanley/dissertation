<p>I've used a WordPress blog and a Screwturn Wiki (at two separate jobs) to store private, company-specific KB info, but I'm looking for something that was created to be a knowledge base.  Specifically, I'd like to see:</p>

<ul>
<li>Free/low cost</li>
<li>Simple method for users to subscribe to KB (or just sections) to get updates</li>
<li>Ability to do page versioning/audit changes</li>
<li>Limit access to certain pages for certain users</li>
<li>Very simple method of posting/editing articles</li>
<li>Very simple method of adding images to articles</li>
<li>Excellent (fast, accurate) searching abilities</li>
<li>Ability to rate and comment on articles</li>
</ul>

<p>I liked using the Wordpress blog because it allowed me to use <a href="http://get.live.com/" rel="nofollow">Live Writer</a> to add/edit articles and images, but it didn't have page versioning (that I could see).</p>

<p>I like using Screwturn wiki because of it's ability to track article versions, and I like it's clean look, but some non-technical people balk at the input and editing.</p>
