<p>I have been looking for a way to utilize a simple markup language, or just plain html, when displaying text in WinForm applications. I would like to avoid embedding a webbrowser control since in most of the case I just want to highlight a single word or two in a sentence. </p>

<p>I have looked at using a RTFControl but I believe it's a bit heavy and I don't think the "language" used to do the formatting is easy.</p>

<p>Is there a simple control that allows me to display strings like:</p>

<p>This is a <strong>sample string</strong> <em>with</em> different formating. </p>

<p>I would be really neat if it was also possible to specify a font and/or size for the text.</p>

<p>Oh, dotnet 3.5 and WPF/xaml is not an option.</p>
