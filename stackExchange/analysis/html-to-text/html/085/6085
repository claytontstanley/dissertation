<p>Our automated build machine needs to archive the version numbers of the OS plus various tools used during each build.  (In case we ever need to replicate exactly the same build later on, perhaps when the machine is long dead.)</p>

<p>I see the command "msinfo32.exe" can be used to dump a whole load of system version information, which we might as well archive.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a way to easily archive the version numbers of the Visual Studio tools?</p>

<p>What mechanisms do other developers use to gather this kind of information for archive purposes?</p>

<p>I agree with you that in 5 years time it'll probably be impossible to recreate the exact OS and tool configuration (down to the nearest security update).  Unfortunately this really comes from a contractual requirement.  As part of our deliverable to a customer we must provide a copy of all source code and clear instructions on exactly how to replicate the build.  It's probably impossible for us to meet this requirement perfectly.</p>

<p>So - I'll just mark your answer as correct (I agree with you that it's practically impossible), and get on with playing with the rest of stack overflow. :)</p>

<p>PS. It would be really great if stack overflow supported replies to answers instead of having to edit the original question.. But I see it has <a href="http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/pages/general/suggestions/14403" rel="nofollow">already been denied</a>.</p>
