<p>What are the most common problems that can be solved with both these data structures?</p>

<p>It would be good for me to have also recommendations on books that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implement the structures</li>
<li>Implement and explain the reasoning of the algorithms that use them</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks!</p>
