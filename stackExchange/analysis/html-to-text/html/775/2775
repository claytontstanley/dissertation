<p>Here's what I use:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CAST(FLOOR(CAST(getdate() as FLOAT)) as DATETIME)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm thinking there may be a better/more elegant way.</p>

<p>Requirements:
  - It has to be as fast as possible (the less casting the better)
  - Final result has to be a datetime type, not a string</p>
