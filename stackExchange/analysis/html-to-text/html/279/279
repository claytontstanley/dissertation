<p>I use AnkhSVN and Visual Studio 2005 and 2008. Now, one thing that bugs me is that Ankh does not really work with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET" rel="nofollow">ASP.NET</a> sites. I cannot add them properly to a repository and it won't detect changes, <strong>especially</strong> because the site is on a remote server accessed through Frontpage Extensions (File => Open Site).</p>

<p>What are the alternatives? Does a better plug-in exist? Manually downloading the files through FTP and using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TortoiseSVN" rel="nofollow">TortoiseSVN</a> or svn.exe is not really the level of integration I want :) I want to stay within the Visual Studio IDE when possible. Also, I do not control the remote Server, so I can not install anything on it, which means the whole change tracking/comparison to repository has to be done on my machine.</p>
