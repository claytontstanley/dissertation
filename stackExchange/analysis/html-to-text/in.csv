19,"<p>Solutions welcome in any language. :-) I'm looking for the fastest way to obtain the value of pi, as a personal challenge. More specifically I'm using ways that don't involve using <code>#define</code>d constants like <code>M_PI</code>, or hard-coding the number in.</p>

<p>The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable; I've included it as a baseline to compare the other versions against. In my tests, with built-ins, the <code>4 * atan(1)</code> version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the <code>atan(1)</code> into a constant. With <code>-fno-builtin</code> specified, the <code>atan2(0, -1)</code> version is fastest.</p>

<p>Here's the main testing program (<code>pitimes.c</code>):</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;

    return pi;

<p>Apart from testing between various compiler flags (I've compared 32-bit against 64-bit too, because the optimisations are different), I've also tried switching the order of the tests around. The <code>atan2(0, -1)</code> version still comes out top every time, though.</p>

This column is a foreign key to my Departments table, where I store the basic department name, id, notes. This is all setup and functioning in my SQL Server.</p>

<p>When I use the XSD tool, I can drag both tables in at once and it auto detects/creates the foreign key I have between these two tables. This works great when I'm on my main page and am viewing contract data.</p>

Another approach: if the string contains 2 different non-numeric characters, use the last one as the decimal separator and discard the others.

<p>That stipulated, what is the best way to migrate from 6.5 to 2005?  Is there any direct path?  Most of the documentation I've found deals with upgrading 6.5 to 7.</p>

<p>Should I forget about the native SQL Server upgrade utilities, script out all of the objects and data, and try to recreate from scratch?</p>

<p>I was going to attempt the upgrade this weekend, but server issues pushed it back till next.  So, any ideas would be welcomed during the course of the week.</p>

<p><em>Update.  This is how I ended up doing it:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Back up the database in question and Master on 6.5.</li>
<li>Execute SQL Server 2000's instcat.sql against 6.5's Master.  This allows SQL Server 2000's OLEDB provider to connect to 6.5.</li>
<li>Use SQL Server 2000's standalone ""Import and Export Data"" to create a DTS package, using OLEDB to connect to 6.5.  This successfully copied all 6.5's tables to a new 2005 database (also using OLEDB).</li>
<li>Use 6.5's Enterprise Manager to script out all of the database's indexes and triggers to a .sql file.</li>
<li>Execute that .sql file against the new copy of the database, in 2005's Management Studio.</li>
<li>Use 6.5's Enterprise Manager to script out all of the stored procedures.</li>
<li>Execute that .sql file against the 2005 database.  Several dozen sprocs had issues making them incompatible with 2005.  Mainly non-ANSI joins and quoted identifier issues.</li>
<li>Corrected all of those issues and re-executed the .sql file.</li>
<li>Recreated the 6.5's logins in 2005 and gave them appropriate permissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>There was a bit of rinse/repeat when correcting the stored procedures (there were hundreds of them to correct), but the upgrade went great otherwise.</p>

<p>Being able to use Management Studio instead of Query Analyzer and Enterprise Manager 6.5 is such an amazing difference.  A few report queries that took 20-30 seconds on the 6.5 database are now running in 1-2 seconds, without any modification, new indexes, or anything.  I didn't expect that kind of immediate improvement.</p>

<p>Or - given the lack of ""EXPLAIN CREATE TABLE"" in T-SQL - do you do something that exports an existing database into SQL-Scripts which you can run on the target server? If yes, is there a tool that can automatically dump a given Database into SQL Queries and that runs off the command line? (Again, Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count).</p>

<p>That looks like a good answer John Downey, I tried it but it appears that it ends up being not a <em>true</em> method.  Your example defines the new patch function with an argument of <strong>self</strong>, but if you write actual code that way, the now patched class method asks for an argument named self (it doesn't automagically recognize it as the identity class, which is what would happen if defined within the class definition), meaning you have to call <strong>class.patch(class)</strong> instead of just <strong>class.patch()</strong> if you want the same functionality as a <em>true</em> method. <strong>It looks like python isn't really treating it as a method, but more just as a variable which happens to be a function</strong> (and as such is callable).

1069,"<p>I'm working on a <strong>multithreaded</strong> C++ application that is corrupting the heap.  The usual tools to locate this corruption seem to be inapplicable.  Old builds (18 months old) of the source code exhibit the same behaviour as the most recent release, so this has been around for a long time and just wasn't noticed; on the downside, source deltas can't be used to identify when the bug was introduced - there are <em>a lot</em> of code changes in the repository.</p>

<p>The prompt for crashing behaviuor is to generate throughput in this system - socket transfer of data which is munged into an internal representation.  I have a set of test data that will periodically cause the app to exception (various places, various causes - including heap alloc failing, thus: heap corruption).</p>

<p>The behaviour seems related to CPU power or memory bandwidth; the more of each the machine has, the easier it is to crash.  Disabling a hyper-threading core or a dual-core core reduces the rate of (but does not eliminate) corruption.  This suggests a timing related issue.</p>

<p>Now here's the rub:<br />
When it's run under a lightweight debug environment (say Visual Studio 98 / AKA MSVC6) the heap corruption is reasonably easy to reproduce - ten or fifteen minutes pass before something fails horrendously and exceptions, like an alloc; when running under a sophisticated debug environment (Rational Purify, VS2008/MSVC9 or even Microsoft Application Verifier) the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn't crash (Memory-bound: CPU is not getting above 50%, disk light is not on, the program's going as fast it can, box consuming 1.3G of 2G of RAM).  So, <strong>I've got a choice between being able to reproduce the problem (but not identify the cause) or being able to idenify the cause or a problem I can't reproduce.</strong></p>

<p>My current best guesses as to where to next is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get an insanely grunty box (to replace the current dev box: 2Gb RAM in an E6550 Core2 Duo); this will make it possible to repro the crash causing mis-behaviour when running under a powerful debug environment; or</li>
<li>Rewrite operators new and delete to use VirtualAlloc and VirtualProtect to mark memory as read-only as soon as it's done with.  Run under MSVC6 and have the OS catch the bad-guy who's writing to freed memory.  Yes, this is a sign of desperation: who the hell rewrites new and delete?!  I wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under Purify et al.</li>
</ol>

<p>And, no: Shipping with Purify instrumentation built in is not an option.</p>

<p>A collegue just walked past and asked ""Stack Overflow?  Are we getting stack overflows now?!?""</p>

<p>And now, the question: <strong>How do I locate the heap corruptor?</strong></p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Update: balancing new[] and delete[] seems to have gotten a long way towards solving the problem.  Instead of 15mins, the app now goes about two hours before crashing.  Not there yet.  Any further suggestions? The heap corruption persists.</p>

<p>Update: a release build under Visual Studio 2008 seems dramatically better; current suspicion rests on the STL implementation that ships with VS98.</p>

1131,"<p>Back in the old days, Help was not trivial but possible: generate some funky .rtf file with special tags, run it through a compiler, and you got a WinHelp file (.hlp) that actually works really well.</p>

<p>Then, Microsoft decided that WinHelp was not hip and cool anymore and switched to CHM, up to the point they actually axed WinHelp from Vista.</p>

<p>Now, CHM maybe nice, but everyone that tried to open a .chm file on the Network will know the nice ""Navigation to the webpage was canceled"" screen that is caused by security restrictions.</p>

<p>While there are ways to make CHM work off the network, this is hardly a good choice, because when a user presses the Help Button he wants help and not have to make some funky settings.</p>

<p>Bottom Line: I find CHM absolutely unusable. But with WinHelp not being an option anymore either, I wonder what the alternatives are, especially when it comes to integrate with my Application (i.e. for WinHelp and CHM there are functions that allow you to directly jump to a topic)?</p>

1145,"<p>I've tried to write a string replace function in C, which works on a char * which has been allocated using malloc().  It's a little different in that it will find and replace strings, rather than characters in the starting string.</p>

<p>It's trivial to do if the search and replace strings are the same length (or the replace string is shorter than the search string), since I have enough space allocated.  If I try to use realloc(), I get an error that tells me I am doing a double free - which I don't see how I am, since I am only using realloc().</p>

<p>Perhaps a little code will help:</p>

<pre><code>void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace) {<br>    int searchLen = strlen(search);<br>    int replaceLen = strlen(replace);<br>    int delta = replaceLen - searchLen;<br>    char *find = input;<br>    while (find = strstr(find, search)) {<br>        if (delta > 0) {<br>            realloc(input, strlen(input) + delta);<br>            find = strstr(input, search);            <br>        }<br>        memmove(find + replaceLen, find + searchLen, strlen(input) - (find - input));<br>        memmove(find, replace, replaceLen);<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>The program works, until I try to realloc() in an instance where the replaced string will be longer than the initial string.  (It still kind of works, it just spits out errors as well as the result).</p>

<p>In the past, I have chosen one of the following two ways that I know to do this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use a single permission table with special columns that are used for determining a how to apply the parameters. The special columns in this example are TypeID and TypeAuxID. The SQL would look something like this. </p>

  FROM application_permissions 
  WHERE 
  (TypeID = 1 AND TypeAuxID = @UserID) OR 
  (TypeID = 2 AND TypeAuxID = @DepartmentID)

<li><p>Use a mapping table for each type of permission, then joining them all together.</p>

1535,"<p>I've never been completely happy with the way exception handling works, there's a lot exceptions and try/catch brings to the table (stack unwinding, etc.), but it seems to break a lot of the OO model in the process.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's the problem:</p>

<p>Let's say you have some class which wraps or includes networked file IO operations (e.g. reading and writing to some file at some particular UNC path somewhere). For various reasons you don't want those IO operations to fail, so if you detect that they fail you retry them and you keep retrying them until they succeed or you reach a timeout. I already have a convenient RetryTimer class which I can instantiate and use to sleep the current thread between retries and determine when the timeout period has elapsed, etc.</p>

<p>The problem is that you have a bunch of IO operations in several methods of this class, and you need to wrap each of them in try-catch / retry logic.</p>

<p>Here's an example code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>RetryTimer fileIORetryTimer = new RetryTimer(TimeSpan.FromHours(10));<br>bool success = false;<br>while (!success)<br>{<br>    try<br>    {<br>        // do some file IO which may succeed or fail<br>        success = true;<br>    }<br>    catch (IOException e)<br>    {<br>        if (fileIORetryTimer.HasExceededRetryTimeout)<br>        {<br>            throw e;<br>        }<br>        fileIORetryTimer.SleepUntilNextRetry();<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>So, how do you avoid duplicating most of this code for every file IO operation throughout the class? My solution was to use anonymous delegate blocks and a single method in the class which executed the delegate block passed to it. This allowed me to do things like this in other methods:</p>

<pre><code>this.RetryFileIO( delegate()<br>    {<br>        // some code block<br>    } );<br></code></pre>

From the UI perspective, the DataContext is a design of the sections of your database that you would like to expose to through LinqToSql and is integral in setting up the ORM features of LinqToSql.</p>

<p>My question is: I am setting up a project that uses a large database where all tables are interconnected in some way through Foreign Keys. My first inclination is to make one huge DataContext class that models the entire database. That way I could in theory (though I don't know if this would be needed in practice) use the Foreign Key connections that are generated through LinqToSql to easily go between related objects in my code, insert related objects, etc.</p>

<p>However, after giving it some thought, I am now thinking that it may make more sense to create multiple DataContext classes, each one relating to a specific namespace or logical interrelated section within my database. My main concern is that instantiating and disposing one huge DataContext class all the time for individual operations that relate to specific areas of the Database would be impose an unnecessary imposition on application resources. Additionally, it is easier to create and manage smaller DataContext files than one big one. The thing that I would lose is that there would be some distant sections of the database that would not be navigable through LinqToSql (even though a chain of relationships connects them in the actual database). Additionally, there would be some table classes that would exist in more than one DataContext.</p>

2196,"<p>I've got an web application that I'm trying to optimise.  Some of the controls are hidden in dialog-style DIVs, so I'd like to have them load in via AJAX only when the user wants to see them.  This is fine for controls that are mostly Literal-based (various menus and widgets), but when I have what I call ""dirty"" controls - ones that write extensive information to the ViewState, put tons of CSS or script on the page, require lots of references etc - these are seemingly impossible to move ""out of page"", especially considering how ASP.NET will react on postback.</p>

<p>I was considering some kind of step where I override Render, find markers for the bits I want to move out and put AJAX placeholders in there, but not only does the server overhead seem extreme, it also feels like a complete hack.  Besides, the key element here is the dialog boxes that contain forms with validation controls on them, and I can't imagine how I would move the controls <em>and</em> their required scripts.</p>

2328,"<p>I have a problem with maintaining state in an ASP.NET AJAX page. Short version: I need some way to update the page ViewState after an async callback has been made, to reflect any state changes the server made during the async call. </p>

<p>This seems to be a common problem, but I will describe my scenario to help explain:</p>

<p>I have a grid-like control which has some JavaScript enhancements - namely, the ability to drag and drop columns and rows. When a column or row is dropped into a new position, an AJAX method is invoked to notify the control server-side and fire a corresponding server-side event (""OnColumnMoved"" or ""OnRowMoved"").</p>

<p>ASP.NET AJAX calls, by default, send the entire page as the request. That way the page goes through a complete lifecycle, viewstate is persisted and the state of the control is restored before the RaiseCallbackEvent method is invoked.</p>

<p>However, since the AJAX call does not update the page, the ViewState reflects the <em>original</em> state of the control, even after the column or row has been moved. So the second time a client-side action occurs, the AJAX request goes to the server and the page &amp; control are built back up again to reflect the <em>first</em> state of the control, not the state after the first column or row was moved.</p>

<p>This problem extends to many implications. For example if we have a client-side/AJAX action to add a new item to the grid, and then a row is dragged, the grid is built server-side with one less item than on the client-side.</p>

<p>And finally &amp; most seriously for my specific example, the actual data source object we are acting upon is stored in the page ViewState. That was a design decision to allow keeping a stateful copy of the manipulated data which can either be committed to DB after many manipulations or discarded if the user backs out. That is very difficult to change.</p>

<p>So, again, I need a way for the page ViewState to be updated on callback after the AJAX method is fired.</p>

The UTS concludes with a section that describes an Application Test of the package.</p>

<p>This doesn't sound like unit testing to me. It sounds a lot more like system integration testing w/ a description of the package. It certainly is not automated.</p>

<p>With our UTS practice in its current state, managing/editing/follwing the documents is not a trivial task. And when enhancements or maintenance work to a given package is needed, there are not strict testing procedures put in place to guarantee outputs are satisfactory.

2872,"<p><strong>My Goal</strong></p>

<p>I would like to have a main processing thread (non GUI), and be able to spin off GUIs in their own background threads as needed, and having my main non GUI thread keep working. Put another way, I want my main non GUI-thread to be the owner of the GUI-thread and not vice versa. I'm not sure this is even possible with Windows Forms(?)</p>

<p>(Sorry for the big post here. I've had complaints about previous shorter versions of this question just isn't comprehensible. I'm a lousy writer)</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I have a component based system in which a controller dynamically load assemblies and instantiates and run classes implementing a common <em>IComponent</em> interface with a single method <em>DoStuff()</em> .</p>

<p>Which components that gets loaded is configured via a xml configuration file and by adding new assemblies containing different implementations of <em>IComponent</em> . The components provides utility functions to the main application. While the main program is doing it's thing, e.g. controlling a nuclear plant, the components might be performing utility tasks (in their own threads), e.g. cleaning the database, sending emails, printing funny jokes on the printer, what have you. What I would like, is to have one of these components be able to display a GUI, e.g. with status information for the said email sending component.</p>

<p>The lifetime of the complete system looks like this</p>

<ol>
<li>Application starts.</li>
<li>Check configuration file for components to load. Load them.</li>
<li><strong>For each component, run DoStuff() to initialize it and make it live its own life in their own threads.</strong></li>
<li>Continue to do main application-thingy king of work, forever.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have not yet been able to successfully perform point 3 if the component fires up a GUI in <em>DoStuff()</em> . It simply just halts until the GUI is closed. And not until the GUI is closed does the program progress to point 4.</p>

<p>It would be great if these components were allowed to start up their own Windows Forms GUIs.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>When a component tries to fire up a GUI in <em>DoStuff()</em> (the exact line of code is when the component runs Application.Run(theForm)) , the component and hence our system ""hangs"" at the Application.Run() line until the GUI is closed. Well, the just fired up GUI works fine, as expected.</p>

<p>Example of components. One hasn't nothing to do with GUI, whilst the second fires up a cute windows with pink fluffy bunnies in them.</p>

<pre><code>public class MyComponent1: IComponent<br>{<br>    public string DoStuff(...) { // write something to the database  }<br>}<br><br>public class MyComponent2: IComponent<br>    public void DoStuff()<br>    {<br>        Application.EnableVisualStyles();<br>        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);<br>        Application.Run(new Form());<br><br>        // I want the thread to immediately return after the GUI <br>        // is fired up, so that my main thread can continue to work.<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>I have tried this with no luck. Even when I try to fire up the GUI in it's own thread, the execution halts until the GUI as closed.</p>

<pre><code>    public void DoStuff()<br>    {<br>           new Thread(ThreadedInitialize).Start()<br>    }<br><br>    private void ThreadedInitialize()<br>    {<br>        Application.EnableVisualStyles();<br>        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);<br>        Application.Run(new Form());<br>    }<br></code></pre>

<p>I've seen a few approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li>simply checking if there is an ""@"" present, which is dead simply but of course not that reliable.</li>
<li>a more complex regex test for standard e-mail formats</li>
<li>a <a href=""http://code.iamcal.com/php/rfc822/full_regexp.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">full regex</a> against <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html"" rel=""nofollow"">RFC 2822</a> - the problem with this is that often an e-mail address might be valid but it is probably not what the user meant </li>
<li>DNS validation</li>
<li>SMTP validation</li>
</ul>

<p>As many people might know (but many don't), e-mail addresses can have a lot of strange variation that most people don't usually consider (see <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html"" rel=""nofollow"">RFC 2822 3.4.1</a>), but you have to think about the goals of your validation: are you simply trying to ensure that an e-mail address can be sent to an address, or that it is what the user probably meant to put in (which is unlikely in a lot of the more obscure cases of otherwise 'valid' addresses).</p>

<p>An option I've considered is simply giving a warning with a more esoteric address but still allowing the request to go through, but this does add more complexity to a form and most users are likely to be confused.</p>

<p>While DNS validation / SMTP validation seem like no-brainers, I foresee problems where the DNS server/SMTP server is temporarily down and a user is unable to register somewhere, or the user's SMTP server doesn't support the required features.</p>

<p>How might some experienced developers out here handle this? Are there any other approaches than the ones I've listed?</p>

<p>Edit: I completely forgot the most obvious of all, sending a confirmation e-mail! Thanks to answerers for pointing that one out. Yes, this one is pretty foolproof, but it does require extra hassle on the part of everyone involved. The user has to fetch some e-mail, and the developer needs to remember user data before they're even confirmed as valid. </p>

It basically means I have tons of container controls beyond the edge of the main window during design time that I have to keep scrolling the main window over to in order to work with them.

3739,"<P>Hi,</P>
<P>I have an unusual situation in which I need a sharepoint timer job to both have local administrator windows privileges and to have SHAREPOINT\System sharepoint privileges.</P>
<P>I can get the windows privileges by simply configuring the timer service to use an account which is a member of local administrators. I understand that this is not a good solution since it gives sharepoint timer service more rights then it is supposed to have. But it at least allows my sharepoint timer job to run stsadm.</P>
<P>Another problem with running the timer service under local administrator is that this user won't necessarily have SHAREPOINT\System sharepoint privilegies which I also need for this sharepoint job. It turns out that SPSecurity.RunWithElevatedPrivilegies won't work in this case. Reflector shows that RunWithElevatedPrivilegies checks if the current process is owstimer (the service process which runs sharepoint jobs) and performs no elevation this is the case (the rational here, I guess, is that the timer service is supposed to run under NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService windows account which which has SHAREPOINT\System sharepoint privileges, and thus there's no need to elevate privileges for a timer job)</P>
<P>The only possible solution here seems to be to run the timer service under it's usual NetworkSerice windows account and to run stsadm as a local administrator by storing the administrator credentials somewhere and passing them to System.Diagnostics.Process.Run() trough the StarInfo's Username, domain and password.</P>
<P>It seems everything should work now, but here is another problem I'm stuck with at the moment. Stsamd is failing with the following error popup (!) (Winternals filemon shows that stsadm is running under the administrator in this case):</P>
<P>The application failed to initialize properly (0x0c0000142). Click OK to terminate the application.</P>

I am using the .net HttpListener class, but I'm won't be running on IIS and am not using ASP.net.  This <a href=""http://www.leastprivilege.com/CommentView.aspx?guid=0c34094a-bdd4-4041-be6e-919f10fe1d31"" rel=""nofollow"">web site</a> describes what code to actual use to implement SSL with asp.net and <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/adarshk/archive/2004/11/10/255467.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">this site</a> describes how to set up the certificates (although I'm not sure if it works only for IIS or not).  </p>

<p>When I the class documentation, it describes various types of authentication (basic, digest, Windows, etc.) - none of them refer to SSL.  It does say that if <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httplistener.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">HTTPS is used, you will need to set a server certificate</a>.  Is this going to be a one line property setting and HttpListener figures out the rest?  </p>

<p>In short, I need to know how to set up the certificates and how to modify the code to implement ssl.</p>

<p>Although it doesn't occur when I'm trying to access HTTPS, I did notice an error in my System Event log - the source is ""Schannel"" and the content of the message is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A fatal error occurred when attempting
  to access the SSL server credential
  private key. The error code returned
  from the cryptographic module is
  0x80090016.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edit: <br>
<strong>Steps taken so far</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Created a working HTTPListener in C# that works for HTTP connections (e.g. ""http://localhost:8089/foldername/""</li>
<li>Created a certificate using makecert.exe</li>
<li>Added the certificate to be trusted using certmgr.exe</li>
<li>Used Httpcfg.exe to listen for SSL connections on a test port (e.g. 8090)</li>
<li>Added port 8080 to the HTTPListener via listener.Prefixes.Add(https://localhost:8090/foldername/"");</li>
<li>tested an HTTP client connection, e.g. (http://localhost:8089/foldername/"") in a browser and receive correct return</li>
<li>tested an HTTPS client connection, e.g. (http://localhost:8090/foldername/"") in a browser and receive ""Data Transfer Interrupted"" (in Firefox)</li>
<li>debugging in visual studio shows that the listener callback that receives the requests never gets hit when the HTTPS connection starts - I don't see any place that I could set a breakpoint to catch anything else earlier.</li>
<li>netstat shows that listening ports are open for both HTTPS and HTTP.  the HTTPS port does go to TIME_WAIT after a connection is attempted.</li>

<li>What could the problem be? </li>
<li>Is there a piece of .Net code I am missing (meaning I have to do more in C# other than simply add a prefix to the listener that points to HTTPS, which is what i have done)</li>

<pre><code>svn merge -r 67212:67213 https://my.svn.repository/trunk .<br></code></pre>

<p>I only had 2 files, one of which is a simple ChangeLog.  Rather than just merging my ChangeLog changes, it actually pulled mine plus some previous ones that were not in the destination ChangeLog.  I noticed there was a conflict when I executed --dry-run, so I updated ChangeLog, and there was STILL a conflict (and I saw the conflict when I did the actual merge).</p>

<p>I then later diffed on the file I was merging from:</p>

4157,"<p>I plan to be storing all my config settings in my application's app.config section (using the ConfigurationManager.AppSettings class). As the user changes settings using the app's UI (clicking checkboxes, choosing radio buttons, etc.), I plan to be writing those changes out to the AppSettings. At the same time, while the program is running I plan to be accessing the AppSettings constantly from a process that will be constantly processing data. Changes to settings via the UI need to affect the data processing in real-time, which is why the process will be accessing the AppSettings constantly.</p>

<p>Is this a good idea with regard to performance? Using AppSettings is supposed to be ""the right way"" to store and access configuration settings when writing .Net apps, but I worry that this method wasn't intended for a constant load (at least in terms of settings being constantly read).</p>

<p>If anyone has experience with this, I would greatly appreciate the input.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I should probably clarify a few points.</p>

<p>This is not a web application, so connecting a database to the application might be overkill simply for storing configuration settings. This is a Windows Forms application.</p>

<p>According to the MSDN documention, the ConfigurationManager is for storing not just application level settings, but user settings as well. (Especially important if, for instance, the application is installed as a partial-trust application.)</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I accepted lomaxx's answer because Properties does indeed look like a good solution, without having to add any additional layers to my application (such as a database). When using Properties, it already does all the caching that others suggested. This means any changes and subsequent reads are all done in memory, making it extremely fast. Properties only writes the changes to disk when you explicitly tell it to. This means I can make changes to the config settings on-the-fly at run time and then only do a final save out to disk when the program exits.</p>

<p>Just to verify it would actually be able to handle the load I need, I did some testing on my laptop and was able to do 750,000 reads and 7,500 writes per second using Properties. That is so far above and beyond what my application will <em>ever</em> even come close to needing that I feel quite safe in using Properties without impacting performance.</p>

We replicate the foxpro to sql nightly and most of our data reads are ok being a day old so we are focusing on the writes. plus the write affects a critical part of the user experience (purchasing), we store it in sql and then just message to have it put into foxpro when it can.

In short, I need to keep track of a relatively small number of values (usually a value of 1, and in rare cases more than 1) in a sea of zeros in the matrix (multidimensional array).  A sparse array allows the user to store a small number of values, and assume all undefined records to be a preset value.  Since is is not physically possibly to store all values in memory (greater in number than the number of particles in the universe :p ), I need to store only the few non-zero elements.

<p>@Balloon - I don't think SMS would be a solution for getting the orders in.  The restaurant doesn't have a cellphone dedicated for itself.

I took a quick look, and it looks great!   I want to clarify this is for a cafe, therefore the ordering must reach the cafe in almost real time.  Any delays in getting the order to the cooks, would slow things up, taking away the benefit of online ordering at a cafe.  </p>

<p>Any suggestions on getting the order to the cafe immediately after the payment is processed?  I think email would go unnoticed.  I believe there is a way in .NET to make a phone call to the cafe, that could alert them of an order and have them print it out.</p>

My question is if anyone has had issues working with Community Server, skinning it and extending it?<br>
I wanted to explain a bit why I am thinking Community Server, the company is wanting multiple blogs with multiple authors.  I want to be out of the admin part of this as much as possible and didn't think there were too many engines that having multiple blogs didn't mean db work.  I also like the other functionality that Community Server provides and think the company will find it useful, particularly the media section as right now we have some really shotty way of dealing with whitepapers and stuff.</p>

<p>edit: We are actually using the Sitecore blog module for a single blog on our intranet (which is actually what the CMS is serving).  Some reasoning for why I don't like it for our public site are they are on different servers, it doesn't support multiple authors, there is no built in syndication, it is a little flimsy feeling to me from looking at the source and I personally think the other features of Community Server make its price tag worth it.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem:</strong><br />
When using IE6 (which the entire user-base uses), the response sent back from the server is a 404 error. </p>

The program works fine in Firefox.<br />
The calling procedure cannot target any procedures within the same package.<br />
The calling procedure can target outside sites (both http, https).<br />
The other AJAX calls in the package that are not posts of form data work fine.<br />

lomaxx, thx for the <a href=""http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/PL/SQL_FAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">fiddler</a> tip. you have no idea how awesome it was to get that and use it as a debugging tool. after starting it up this is what i found and how i fixed it (at least in the short term):</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>After seeing that message from the server, I kicked around Fiddler a bit more to see what else I could learn from it. Found that there's a WebForms tab that shows the values in the web form. Wouldn't you know it, the ""xxx_DISPLAYED_"" fields above were in it. </p>

<p>I don't really understand yet why these fields exist, because I didn't create them explicitly in the web PLSQL code. But I do understand now that the target procedure has to include them as parameters to work correctly. Again, this is only in the case of IE6 for me, as Firefox worked fine.</p>

<p>Well, that the short term answer and hack to fix it. Hopefully, a little more work in this area will lead to a better understanding of the fundamentals going on here. </p>

5831,"<p>Does anyone have, or know of, a binary patch generation algorithm implementation in C#?</p>

<p>Basically, compare two files (designated <em>old</em> and <em>new</em>), and produce a patch file that can be used to upgrade the <em>old</em> file to have the same contents as the <em>new</em> file.</p>

<p>The implementation would have to be relatively fast, and work with huge files. It should exhibit O(n) or O(logn) runtimes.</p>

<p>My own algorithms tend to either be lousy (fast but produce huge patches) or slow (produce small patches but have O(n^2) runtime).</p>

<p>Any advice, or pointers for implementation would be nice.</p>

<p>Specifically, the implementation will be used to keep servers in sync for various large datafiles that we have one master server for. When the master server datafiles change, we need to update several off-site servers as well.</p>

<p>The most naive algorithm I have made, which only works for files that can be kept in memory, is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Grab the first four bytes from the <em>old</em> file, call this the <em>key</em></li>
<li>Add those bytes to a dictionary, where <em>key -> position</em>, where <em>position</em> is the position where I grabbed those 4 bytes, 0 to begin with</li>
<li>Skip the first of these four bytes, grab another 4 (3 overlap, 1 one), and add to the dictionary the same way</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1-3 for all 4-byte blocks in the <em>old</em> file</li>
<li>From the start of the <em>new</em> file, grab 4 bytes, and attempt to look it up in the dictionary</li>
<li>If found, find the longest match if there are several, by comparing bytes from the two files</li>
<li>Encode a reference to that location in the <em>old</em> file, and skip the matched block in the <em>new</em> file</li>
<li>If not found, encode 1 byte from the <em>new</em> file, and skip it</li>
<li>Repeat steps 5-8 for the rest of the <em>new</em> file</li>
</ol>

<p>This is somewhat like compression, without windowing, so it will use a lot of memory. It is, however, fairly fast, and produces quite small patches, as long as I try to make the codes output minimal.</p>

<p>A more memory-efficient algorithm uses windowing, but produces much bigger patch files.</p>

<p>There are more nuances to the above algorithm that I skipped in this post, but I can post more details if necessary. I do, however, feel that I need a different algorithm altogether, so improving on the above algorithm is probably not going to get me far enough.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Edit #1</strong>: Here is a more detailed description of the above algorithm.</p>

<p>First, combine the two files, so that you have one big file. Remember the cut-point between the two files.</p>

<p>Secondly, do that <em>grab 4 bytes and add their position to the dictionary</em> step for everything in the whole file.</p>

<p>Thirdly, from where the <em>new</em> file starts, do the loop with attempting to locate an existing combination of 4 bytes, and find the longest match. Make sure we only consider positions from the old file, or from <em>earlier in the new file than we're currently at</em>. This ensures that we can reuse material in both the old and the new file during patch application.</p>

But when using a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer"" rel=""nofollow"">REST</a> or Rails-like URL scheme for object instances, I'd then end up with URLs like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://example.com/user/783<br></code></pre>

<p>And then the assumption is that there are also users with IDs of 782, 781, ..., 2, and 1. Assuming that the web app in question is secure enough to prevent people entering other numbers to view other users without authorization, a simple sequentially-assigned surrogate key also ""leaks"" the total number of instances (older than this one), in this case users, which might be privileged information. (For instance, I am user #726 in stackoverflow.)</p>

<p>Would a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuid"" rel=""nofollow"">UUID</a>/GUID be a better solution? Then I could set up URLs like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://example.com/user/035a46e0-6550-11dd-ad8b-0800200c9a66<br></code></pre>

<p>Not exactly succinct, but there's less implied information about users on display. Sure, it smacks of ""security through obscurity"" which is no substitute for proper security, but it seems at least a little more secure.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: for those who asked about just using the user name in the URL (e.g., http://example.com/user/yukondude), that works fine for object instances with names that are unique, but what about the zillions of web app objects that can really only be identified by number?

5966,"<p>Basically, I've written an API to www.thetvdb.com in Python. The current code can be found <a href=""http://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api/tree/master/tvdb_api.py"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>It grabs data from the API as requested, and has to store the data somehow, and make it available by doing:</p>

<pre><code>print tvdbinstance[1][23]['episodename'] # get the name of episode 23 of season 1<br></code></pre>

<p>What is the ""best"" way to abstract this data within the Tvdb() class?</p>

<p>I originally used a extended Dict() that automatically created sub-dicts (so you could do <code>x[1][2][3][4] = ""something""</code> without having to do <code>if x[1].has_key(2): x[1][2] = []</code> and so on)</p>

<p>Then I just stored the data by doing <code>self.data[show_id][season_number][episode_number][attribute_name] = ""something""</code></p>

<p>This worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if x[3][24] was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn't raise the season_not_found exception)</p>

<p>Currently it's using four classes. ShowContainer, Show, Season and Episode. Each one is a very basic dict, which I can easily add extra functionality in (the search() function on Show() for example). Each has a <code>__setitem__</code>, <code>__getitem_</code> and <code>has_key</code></p>

<p>This works mostly fine, I can check in Shows if it has that season in it's self.data dict, if not, raise season_not_found. Check in Season() if it has that episode and so on.</p>

<p>The problem now is it's presenting itself as a dict, but doesn't have all the functionality, and because I'm overriding the <em>_getitem_</em> and <em>_setitem_</em> functions, it's easy to accidently recursively call <em>_getitem_</em> (so I'm not sure if extending the Dict class will cause problems)</p>

<p>The other slight problem is adding data into the dict is a lot more work than the old Ddict method (which was <code>self.data[seas_no][ep_no]['attribute'] = 'something'</code>). See _setItem and _setData. It's not too bad, since it's currently only a read-only API interface (so the users of the API should only ever retrieve data, not add more), but it's hardly.. elegant..</p>

<p>I think the series-of-classes system is probably the best way, but does anyone have a better idea for storing the data? And would extending the ShowContainer/etc classes with Dict cause problems?</p>",<python><data-structures>,"Best way to abstract season/show/episode data"

5989,"<p>I've been programming since college, was a hobbyist programmer as a kid, but never got serious until I was a freshman. That was almost a decade and a half ago. One thing I've noticed is that when people reach a certain point in their skills they never really move beyond that. That is if they suck as a developer when you hire them, they will always suck. 10 years of C# experience doesn't necessarily make you a better developer than someone with 6 months of experience.

6371,"<p>I've had a hard time trying to find good examples of how to manage database schemas and data between development, test, and production servers.</p>

<p>Here's our setup. Each developer has a virtual machine running our app and the MySQL database. It is their personal sandbox to do whatever they want. Currently, developers will make a change to the SQL schema and do a dump of the database to a text file that they commit into SVN.</p>

<p>We're wanting to deploy a continuous integration development server that will always be running the latest committed code. If we do that now, it will reload the database from SVN for each build.</p>

<p>We have a test (virtual) server that runs ""release candidates."" Deploying to the test server is currently a very manual process, and usually involves me loading the latest SQL from SVN and tweaking it. Also, the data on the test server is inconsistent. You end up with whatever test data the last developer to commit had on his sandbox server.</p>

<p>Where everything breaks down is the deployment to production. Since we can't overwrite the live data with test data, this involves manually re-creating all the schema changes. If there were a large number of schema changes or conversion scripts to manipulate the data, this can get really hairy.</p>

<p>If the problem was just the schema, It'd be an easier problem, but there is ""base"" data in the database that is updated during development as well, such as meta-data in security and permissions tables.</p>

<p>This is the biggest barrier I see in moving toward continuous integration and one-step-builds. How do <strong><em>you</em></strong> solve it?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>A follow-up question: how do you track database versions so you know which scripts to run to upgrade a given database instance? Is a version table like Lance mentions below the standard procedure?</p>

<p>Thanks for the reference to Tarantino.

<p>I'm going to write a python script that checks the names of *.sql scripts in a given directory against a table in the database and runs the ones that aren't there in order based on a integer that forms the first part of the filename. If it is, as I suspect it will be, a pretty simple solution then I'll post it here.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>I've got a working script for this. It handles initializing the DB if it doesn't exist and running upgrade scripts as necessary. There are also switches for wiping an existing database and importing test data from a file. It's about 200 lines, so I won't post it (though I might put it on pastebin if there's interest.)</p>

It seemed pretty robust, but we found out that it wasn't terribly configurable.  Or at least not configurable enough to meet our needs.

<p>So, my question:</p>

<p>I am still kinda new to the ASP.NET world, so I could be way off base here, but so far this is to the best of my (limited) knowledge!</p>

<p>Lets say I have a standard business object.. ""Contact"" in the <em>Business</em> namespace.. I write a Web Service to retrieve a Contact's info from a database, and return it. I then write a client application to request said details.</p>

<p>Now, I also then create a utility method that takes a ""Contact"" and does some magic with it, like <em>Utils.BuyContactNewHat()</em> say.. Which of course takes the Contact of type <em>Business.Contact</em>.</p>

<p>I then go back to my client application and want to utilise the <em>BuyContactNewHat</em> method, so I add a reference to my <em>Utils</em> namespace and there it is. However, a problem arises with:</p>

<pre><code>Contact c = MyWebService.GetContact(""Rob);
Utils.BuyContactNewHat(c); // &lt;&lt; Error Here
</code></pre>

<p>Since the return type of <em>GetContact</em> is of <em>MyWebService.Contact</em> and not <em>Business.Contact</em> as expected.<br />
I understand why this is, because when accessing a web service, you are actually programming against the proxy class generated by the WSDL..  </p>

<p>So, is there an ""easier"" way to deal with this type mismatch? I was considering perhaps trying to create a generic converter class that uses reflection to ensure two objects have the same structure, then simply transferring the values across from one to the other..</p>

<p>Thanks guys, sorry for the long question, just wanted to ensure I explained the problem clearly :)

<p>The best I've come up with so far is to pull all of the interesting logic for the child form into a Class Module, and have each parent form lay out the UI (in a Picture control, perhaps) and pass that Picture object into the class module.

7084,"<p>I've worked on a number of different embedded systems.  They have all used typedefs (or #defines) for types such as UINT32.</p>

<p>This is a good technique as it drives home the size of the type to the programmer and makes you more conscious of chances for overflow etc.</p>

<p>But on some systems you know that the compiler and processor won't change for the life of the project.</p>

<p>So what should influence your decision to create and enforce project-specific types?</p>

<p>EDIT
I think I managed to lose the gist of my question, and maybe it's really two.</p>

<p>With embedded programming you may need types of specific size for interfaces and also to cope with restricted resources such as RAM.  This can't be avoided, but you can choose to use the basic types from the compiler.</p>

<p>For everything else the types have less importance.<br />
You need to be careful not to cause overflow and may need to watch out for register and stack usage.  Which may lead you to UINT16, UCHAR.
Using types such as UCHAR can add compiler 'fluff' however.  Because registers are typically larger, some compilers may add code to force the result into the type.<br />
<PRE>    i++;</PRE>
can become
<PRE>    ADD REG,1
    AND REG, 0xFF</PRE>
which is unecessary.</p>

You have to do this from a command prompt (or a batch file) because Windows Explorer doesn't let you view the relevant subdirectory of c:\windows\assembly.</p>

<p>However, if you do this, the next time you try to deploy the workflow from within Visual Studio, it complains that it can't be deployed because ""the file may not be signed"" and if you attempt to copy the new version of the dll into the GAC, it tells you that the .dll file is locked.</p>

7398,"<p>I haven't seen any questions relating to GNU autoconf/automake builds, but I'm hoping at least some of you out there are familiar with it.  Here goes:</p>

<p>I have a project (I'll call it myproject) that includes another project (vendor).  The vendor project is a standalone project maintained by someone else.  Including a project like this is fairly <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html#Subdirectories"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Reading List: Fog Creek Software Management Training Program"">straightforward</a>, but in this case there is a tiny snag: each project generates its own config.h file, each of which defines standard macros such as PACKAGE, VERSION, etc.  This means that, during the build, when vendor is being built, I get lots of errors like this:</p>

<pre><code>... warning: ""VERSION"" redefined
... warning: this is the location of the previous definition
... warning: ""PACKAGE"" redefined
... warning: this is the location of the previous definition
</code></pre>

<p>These are just warnings, for the time being at least, but I would like to get rid of them.

<p>In the past I've picked a tool, installed it on my machine first, hit the home page, upping the concurrency settings. Then I'd write a simple login script, a simple site walkthrough (in an ecommerce site adding a few items to a cart and checkout). Then I'd rope in as many developers as I could, install the stress test tool on their machines and do a massive attack. If nothing broke I'd give up and wait for the actual traffic to kill the site for real. </p>

<p>Just hitting the homepage hard almost always would locate a major problem. More scalability problems would surface at the second stage, and even more - after the launch.</p>

This should yield two serialized arrays where the array containing the two-byte characters should have length +1.</p>

7990,"<p>I am working on a project right now that involves receiving a message from another application, formatting the contents of that message, and sending it to a printer.  Technology of choice is C# windows service.  The output could be called a report, I suppose, but a reporting engine is not necessary.  A simple templating engine, like StringTemplate, or even XSLT outputting HTML would be fine.  The problem I'm having is finding a free way to print this kind of output from a service.  Since it <em>seems</em> that it will work, I'm working on a prototype using Microsoft's RDLC, populating a local report and then rendering it as an image to a memory stream, which I will then print.  Issues with that are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multi-page printing will be a big headache.</li>
<li>Still have to use PrintDocument to print the memory stream, which is unsupported in a Windows Service (though it may work - haven't gotten that far with the prototype yet)</li>
<li>If the data coming across changes, I have to change the dataset, and the class that the data is being deserialized into.  bad bad bad.</li>
</ul>

<p>Has anyone had to do anything remotely like this?  Any advice?  I already posed a question about printing HTML without user input, and after wasting about 3 days on that, I have come to the conclusion that it cannot be done, at least not with any freely available tool.</p>

7991,"<p>I'm using the .NETCF (Windows Mobile) Graphics class and the DrawString() method to render a single character to the screen.  The problem is that I can't seem to get it centered properly.  No matter what I set for the Y coordinate of the location of the string render, it always comes out lower than that and the larger the text size the greater the Y offset.  For example, at text size 12, the offset is about 4, but at 32 the offset is about 10.  I want the character to vertically take up most of the rectangle it's being drawn in and be centered horizontally. Here's my basic code.  ""this"" is referencing the user control it's being drawn in.</p>

<pre><code>        Graphics g = this.CreateGraphics();

        float padx = ((float)this.Size.Width) * (0.05F);
        float pady = ((float)this.Size.Height) * (0.05F);

            new SolidBrush(Color.Black), padx, pady);

8042,"<p>The new extensions in .Net 3.5 allow functionality to be split out from interfaces.</p>

<p>For instance in .Net 2.0</p>

<pre><code>public interface IHaveChildren {
    string ParentType { get; }
    int ParentId { get; }

    List&lt;IChild&gt; GetChildren()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Can (in 3.5) become:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IHaveChildren {
    string ParentType { get; }
    int ParentId { get; }
}

public static class HaveChildrenExtension {
    public static List&lt;IChild&gt; GetChildren( this IHaveChildren ) {
        //logic to get children by parent type and id
        //shared for all classes implementing IHaveChildren 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to me to be a better mechanism for many interfaces.  They no longer need an abstract base to share this code, and functionally the code works the same. This could make code more maintainable and easier to test.</p>

<p>The only disadvantage being that an abstract bases implementation can be virtual, but can that be worked around (would an instance method hide an extension method with the same name? would it be confusing code to do so?)</p>

<p>Any other reasons not to regularly use this pattern?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Clarification:</p>

<p>Yeah, I see the tendency with extension methods is to end up with them everywhere. I'd be particularly careful having any on .Net value types without a great deal of peer review (I think the only one we have on string is a <code>.SplitToDictionary()</code> - similar to <code>.Split()</code> but taking a key-value delimiter too)</p>

<p>I think there's a whole best practice debate there ;-)</p>

<p>(Incidentally: DannySmurf, your PM sounds scary.)</p>

<p>I'm specifically asking here about using extension methods where previously we had interface methods.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>I'm trying to avoid lots of levels of abstract base classes - the classes implementing these models mostly already have base classes. I think this model could be more maintainable and less overly-coupled than adding further object hierarchies.</p>

Occasionally a build will fail and a symptom is that there are conflicts in the CruiseControl.NET working copy. I believe this is due to the way I've setup the Visual Studio solutions. Hopefully the more projects we run in this environment the better our understanding of how to set them up will be so I'm not questioning why the conflicts happen at this stage. To fix the builds I delete the working copy and force a new build - this works every time (currently). So my questions are: is deleting the working copy a valid part of a continuous integration build process, and how do I go about it?</p>
