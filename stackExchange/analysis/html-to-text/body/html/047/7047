<P>I have a terrible habit of half-cooking up an idea for a project and then once I feel that I've <STRONG><EM>solved the interesting bits</EM></STRONG> it gets boring and I move on. Of course, experience with the projects that I do end up following through on says that I haven't <STRONG><EM>solved</EM></STRONG> it at all.</P>
<P>What techniques do you employ to try and deal with this sort of behavior?</P>
