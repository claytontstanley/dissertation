<p>When restoring a SQL Server Database, I notice that there are 3 different Recovery States to choose from:</p>

<ul>
<li>Restore with Recovery</li>
<li>Restore with No Recovery</li>
<li>Restore with Standby</li>
</ul>

<p>I've always left it at it's default value, but what do they all mean?</p>

<p>(Preferably in layman's terms)</p>
