<p>What code analysis tools do you use on your Java projects?</p>

<p>I am interested in all kinds</p>

<ul>
<li>static code analysis tools (FindBugs, PMD, and any others)</li>
<li>code coverage tools (Cobertura, Emma, and any others)</li>
<li>any other instrumentation-based tools </li>
<li>anything else, if I'm missing something</li>
</ul>

<p>If applicable, also state what build tools you use and how well these tools integrate with both your IDEs and build tools. </p>

<p>If a tool is only available a specific way (as an IDE plugin, or, say, a build tool plugin) that information is also worth noting.</p>
