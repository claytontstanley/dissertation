<p>I have had horrible procrastination habits since gradeschool, and now that I'm in college, I still am having a hard time beating this bad habit. I find myself easily distracted from doing real "work" and find myself wandering off doing something else that I enjoy more.</p>

<p>Tell me how you personally beat procrastination; or share your struggles.</p>
