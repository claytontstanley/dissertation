<p>Are there any offline tools available for Wordpress theme development other than Dreamweaver extentions?</p>

<p>I'm looking for something that renders a page in a Gecko (or related widget) window in response to my editing of the theme code so I don't need keep editing files on a web server.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>EDIT:
Should have been more clear.  I have test servers in place I was just looking for an application that shows a representation of the standard wordpress views (index,archive,single post etc) and a basic syntax highlighting editor.</p>
