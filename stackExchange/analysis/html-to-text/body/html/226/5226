<p>I am currently in the process of creating my own blog and I have got to marking up the comments, but what is the best way to mark it up?</p>

<p>The information I need to present is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Persons Name</li>
<li>Gravatar Icon</li>
<li>Comment Date</li>
<li>The Comment</li>
</ol>

<p>Any idea's would be much appriciated.</p>

<p><em>PS: I'm only interested in semantic html markup.</em></p>
