<p>I've got a website that I've just uploaded onto the interwebs, and when using Firefox 3.0.1 on Ubuntu I don't see the favicon; Firefox 3.0.1 on WinXP shows it.</p>

<p><strong>Why</strong> isn't the favicon displaying under Ubuntu?   It's a favicon.ico file in the root directory, not referenced in the meta tags; would it work better as a GIF?</p>
