<P>Does anyone here use VB.NET and have a strong preference for or against using 'IsNothing' as opposed to 'Is Nothing' (for example, 'If IsNothing(anObject)' or If anObject Is Nothing...')? If so, why?</P>
<P>EDIT: If you think they're both equally acceptable, do you think it's best to pick one and stick with it, or is it OK to mix them?</P>
