<p>I want some links to include a fragment identifier. Like some of the URLs on this site:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5619/ie6-ssl-ajax-post-form-404-error" rel="nofollow">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5619/ie6-ssl-ajax-post-form-404-error</a><strong>#5626</strong></p>

<p>Is there a way to do this with any of the builtin methods in MVC? Or would I have to roll my own HTML helpers?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
