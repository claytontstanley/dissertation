<p>I have a MySQL table with approximately 3000 rows per user. One of the columns is a datetime field, which is mutable, so the rows aren't in chronological order.</p>

<p>I'd like to visualize the time distribution in a chart, so I need a number of individual datapoints. 20 datapoints would be enough.</p>

<p>I could do this:</p>

<pre><code>select timefield from entries where uid = ? order by timefield;
</code></pre>

<p>and look at every 150th row.</p>

<p>Or I could do 20 separate queries and use <code>limit 1</code> and <code>offset</code>. </p>

<p>But there must be a more efficient solution...</p>

<p>UPDATE: still unanswered</p>
