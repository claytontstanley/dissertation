<p>Hi guys, as you can probably tell from my rep, I have just got my invite so I am a complete n00b! :D First off I would like to say thanks to Jeff and the team for what looks like is going to be an <strong>excellent</strong> site for the community.</p>

<p>So, my question:</p>

<p>I am still kinda new to the ASP.NET world, so I could be way off base here, but so far this is to the best of my (limited) knowledge!</p>

<p>Lets say I have a standard business object.. "Contact" in the <em>Business</em> namespace.. I write a Web Service to retrieve a Contact's info from a database, and return it. I then write a client application to request said details.</p>

<p>Now, I also then create a utility method that takes a "Contact" and does some magic with it, like <em>Utils.BuyContactNewHat()</em> say.. Which of course takes the Contact of type <em>Business.Contact</em>.</p>

<p>I then go back to my client application and want to utilise the <em>BuyContactNewHat</em> method, so I add a reference to my <em>Utils</em> namespace and there it is. However, a problem arises with:</p>

<pre><code>Contact c = MyWebService.GetContact("Rob);
Utils.BuyContactNewHat(c); // &lt;&lt; Error Here
</code></pre>

<p>Since the return type of <em>GetContact</em> is of <em>MyWebService.Contact</em> and not <em>Business.Contact</em> as expected.<br />
I understand why this is, because when accessing a web service, you are actually programming against the proxy class generated by the WSDL..  </p>

<p>So, is there an "easier" way to deal with this type mismatch? I was considering perhaps trying to create a generic converter class that uses reflection to ensure two objects have the same structure, then simply transferring the values across from one to the other..</p>

<p>Thanks guys, sorry for the long question, just wanted to ensure I explained the problem clearly :)

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thanks to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/571/lance-fisher" rel="nofollow">Lance Fisher</a> for the answer posted. If anyone can recommend and good methods for the "deep copy" of the objects in question, I would love some input! :)

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thanks to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1039/dan-thompson" rel="nofollow">Dan Thompson</a> for the idea on copying the code generated by VS via WSDL. I have looked at that sort of scenario before, but the problem is that the services are succeptable to change, meaning the "hack" requires regen, re-copy, re-edit etc. I have +1'd this though since it is a good idea, especially for services that are pretty mature and not likely to change. Thanks.</p>
