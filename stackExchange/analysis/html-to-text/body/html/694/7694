<p>Is that even a valid question? I have a .Net windows app that is using MSTDC and it throwing an exception:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>System.Transactions.TransactionManagerCommunicationException:
  Network access for Distributed
  Transaction Manager (MSDTC) has been
  disabled. Please enable DTC for
  network access in the security
  configuration for MSDTC using the
  Component Services Administrative tool --->
  System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x8004D024): The
  transaction manager has disabled its support for remote/network
  transactions. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8004D024)
     at
  System.Transactions.Oletx.IDtcProxyShimFactory.ReceiveTransaction(UInt32
  propgationTokenSize, Byte[] propgationToken, IntPtr managedIdentifier,
  Guid&amp; transactionIdentifier, OletxTransactionIsolationLevel&amp;
  isolationLevel, ITransactionShim&amp; transactionShim)....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I follow the guide <a href="http://kbalertz.com/883960/enable-MSDTC-communications-Commerce-Server-Developer-Edition-Windows-Service.aspx">here</a> to able MSTDC on the pc, on which the app is installed. But the error still occurs. I was wondering if this was a DB issue? And if so how can i resolve it?</p>
