<p>I've made many different seperate parts of a GUI system for the Nintendo DS, like buttons and textboxes and select boxes, but I need a way of containing these classes in one Gui class, so that I can draw everything to the screen all at once, and check all the buttons at once to check if any are being pressed. My question is what is the best way organize all the classes (such as buttons and textboxes) into one GUI class?</p>

<p>Here's one way I thought of but it doesn't seem right:</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I'm using C++.</p>

<pre><code> class Gui {
      public:
           void update_all();
           void draw_all() const;
           int add_button(Button *button); // Returns button id
           void remove_button(int button_id);
      private:
           Button *buttons[10];
           int num_buttons;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>This code has a few problems, but I just wanted to give you an idea of what I want.</p>
