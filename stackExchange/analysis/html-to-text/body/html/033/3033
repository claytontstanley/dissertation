<p>If I have a Perl hash with a bunch of (key, value) pairs, what is the preferred method of iterating through all the keys?  I have heard that using <code>each</code> may in some way have unintended side effects.  So, is that true, and is one of the two following methods best, or is there a better way?</p>

<pre><code># Method 1
while (my ($key, $value) = each(%hash)) {
    # Something
}

# Method 2
foreach my $key (keys(%hash)) {
    # Something
}
</code></pre>
