<p>Let's aggregate a list of free quality web site design templates. There are a million of these sites out there, but most are repetitive and boring. </p>

<p>I'll start with <a href="http://www.freecsstemplates.org/" rel="nofollow">freeCSStemplates.org</a></p>

<p>I also think other sites should follow some sort of standards, for example here are freeCSStemplates standards</p>

<ul>
<li>Released for FREE under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 license </li>
<li>Very lightweight in terms of images </li>
<li>Tables-free (ie. they use no tables for layout purposes) </li>
<li>W3C standards compliant and valid (XHTML Strict) </li>
