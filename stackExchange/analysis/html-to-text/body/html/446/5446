<p>I've been asked to join in with a project and there is no actual leader (it's not a business setting), worse still there are about 8 members and because of this, there is no actual action plan. I'd volunteer myself as the leader or manager but I don't have the time or inclination to do so, should I just watch it struggle (and possibly never even take form) or is there something more constructive I can be doing?</p>
