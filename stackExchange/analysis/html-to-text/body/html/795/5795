<p>C# and .NET has become the official programming platform at my company for all new IT projects. I'm a bioinformatics scientist with 15 years of experience with C, C++, and Perl. And, fortunately, I'm not in IT, so I don't have to do my work using C#. But I anticipate having to work on a project with a C# programmer, so it's time for me to learn C#.</p>

<p>I'm old-fashioned, so I like to learn from books. In your experience, what books have you found useful for learning C#?</p>
