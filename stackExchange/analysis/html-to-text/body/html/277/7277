<p>I'm generating some XML documents and when it comes to the address part I have fragments that look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Address&gt;15 Sample St
Example Bay
Some Country&lt;/Address&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The XSLT that I have for converting this to XHTML has some funky recursive template to convert newline characters within strings to &lt;br/&gt; tags.</p>

<p>This is all working fine; but is it considered "bad practice" to rely on linebreaks within XML documents?  If so, is it recommended that I do this instead?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Address&gt;&lt;Line&gt;15 Sample St&lt;/Line&gt;
&lt;Line&gt;Example Bay&lt;/Line&gt;
&lt;Line&gt;Some Country&lt;/Line&gt;&lt;/Address&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Seems like it'd be really awkward to wrap every place where my text may be multiple lines with tags like that..</p>
