<p>I know that just using rand() is predictable, if you know what your doing, and have access to the server.<br /></p>

<p>I have a project that is HIGHLY dependent on choosing a random that is as unpredictable as possible. So I'm looking for suggestions, either other built in functions, or user functions that can generate a 'better' random number.<br /><br />
I used this to do a little test:</p>

<pre><code>$i=0;
    while($i&lt;10000)
     {
      $rand = rand(0,100);
     if(!isset($array[$rand]))
      {
      $array[$rand] = 1;
      }
     else 
      {
      $array[$rand]++;
      }
     sort($array);
     $i++;
     }
</code></pre>

<p>I found the results to be evenly distributed, and there is an odd pattern to the number of times each number is generated.</p>
