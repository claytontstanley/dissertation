<p>I'm looking to learn python and wasn't sure what IDE's are available, what is the best one, etc.  As a way of making the question more general, lets try to establish a definitive list of the best IDE for all languages.  Here's a start</p>

<p>.NET: MS VS<br/>
Java: Eclipse<br/>
Ruby: ?<br/>
Python: ?<br/>
x86 Assembly: ?<br/>
 others....</p>
