<p>In Ruby 1.8, there are subtle differences between proc/lambda on the one hand, and Proc.new on the other. </p>

<ul>
<li>What are those differences?</li>
<li>Can you give guidelines on how to decide which one to choose?</li>
<li>In Ruby 1.9, proc and lambda are different. What's the deal?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>@Mike Stone: there's no difference between 1.8 and 1.9 in this regard.</p>

<p>@Accordeon Guy: that's the difference I had in mind, but I don't think it's the whole story. What about next/break/return in procs? What about Ruby 1.9? What about scopes, and returning procs from a method?</p>
