<p>What are the recommended online or offline resources for Objective-C and Cocoa programming?</p>

<p>My online resources:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://oreilly.com/pub/ct/37" rel="nofollow">O'Reilly</a>, Some useful articles and examples, but has not been updated for quite a while</li>
<li><a href="http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn%5Fobjectivec/" rel="nofollow">Learning Objective C</a>, This seems like a good resource so far</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mac-developer-network.com/podcasts/latenightcocoa/index.html" rel="nofollow">Late Night Cocoa Podcast</a>, I recently discovered this one, starting on episode 1</li>
</ul>

<p>My offline resources: </p>

<ul>
<li>None, I have no books on my shelf</li>
</ul>

<p>I need some help finding a good book, any suggestions?</p>
