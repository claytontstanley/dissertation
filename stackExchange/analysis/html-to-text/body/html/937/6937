<p><a href="http://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/" rel="nofollow">Ultramon</a> is a great program for dual monitors (stretching screen across monitors), but I was wondering if there is any way do to something in Visual Studio like have one tab of code open on one monitor and a second tab of code open on the second monitor with only one instance of Visual Studio running?</p>

<p>Or are there any other suggestions on getting most bang for buck on dual monitors and Visual Studio?</p>
