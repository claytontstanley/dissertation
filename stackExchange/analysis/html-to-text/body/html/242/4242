<p>I want to convert a primitive to a string, and I tried:</p>

<pre><code>myInt.toString();
</code></pre>

<p>This fails with the error:</p>

<pre><code>int cannot be dereferenced
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I get that primitives are not reference types (ie, not an Object) and so cannot have methods.  However, Java 5 introduced autoboxing and unboxing (a la C#... which I never liked in C#, but that's beside the point).  So with autoboxing, I would expect the above to convert myInt to an Integer and then call toString() on that.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I believe C# allows such a call, unless I remember incorrectly.  Is this just an unfortunate shortcoming of Java's autoboxing/unboxing specification, or is there a good reason for this?</p>
