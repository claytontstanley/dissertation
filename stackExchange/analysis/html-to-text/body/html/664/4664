<p>Should the folders in a solution match the namespace?</p>

<p>In one of my teams projects, we have a class library that has many sub-folders in the project.</p>

<p>Project Name and Namespace: MyCompany.Project.Section</p>

<p>Within this project, there are several folders that match the namespace section:
- Folder Vehicles has classes in the MyCompany.Project.Section.Vehicles namespace
- Folder Clothing has classes in the MyCompany.Project.Section.Clothing namespace
- etc.</p>

<p>Inside this same project, is another rogue folder
- Folder BusinessObjects has classes in the MyCompany.Project.Section namespace</p>

<p>There are a few cases like this where folders are made for "organizational convenience".</p>

<p>My question is: What's the standard?  In class libraries do the folders usually match the namespace structure or is it a mixed bag?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
