<p>I am trying to enable Full-text indexing in SQL Server 2005 Express. I am running this on my laptop with Vista Ultimate.</p>

<p>I understand that the standard version of SQL Server Express does not have full-text indexing. I have already downloaded and installed "Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition with Advanced Services Service Pack 2" (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=5B5528B9-13E1-4DB9-A3FC-82116D598C3D&amp;displaylang=en" rel="nofollow">download</a>).</p>

<p>I have also ensured that both the "SQL Server (instance)" and "SQL Server FullText Search (instance)" services are running on the same account which is "Network Service".</p>

<p>I have also selected the option to "Use full-text indexing" in the Database Properties > Files area.</p>

<p>I can run the sql query "SELECT fulltextserviceproperty('IsFulltextInstalled');" and return 1.</p>

<p>The problem I am having is that when I have my table open in design view and select "Manage FullText Index"; the full-text index window displays the message... </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Creation of the full-text index is not available. Check that you have the correct permissions or that full-text catalogs are defined."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any ideas on what to check or where to go next?</p>
