<p>I am looking to allow users to control of subdomain of an app I am toying with, much like Basecamp where it is 'customusername.seework.com'.</p>

<p>What is required on the DNS end to allow these to be created dynamically and be available instantly. </p>

<p>And how do you recommend dealing with this in the logic of the site? Htaccess rule to  lookup the subdomain in the DB?</p>

<p>thanks</p>
