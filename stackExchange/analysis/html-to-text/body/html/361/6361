<p>I have a company that would like to bring me in to serve me <strong>an hour long exam</strong>. <strong>No resources other than a pencil and paper</strong>.  I really couldn't get any sort of feedback on the type of exam (implementation or generic) beside that it would test a few specific areas.</p>

<p>Have you done anything like this? What sort of questions did they ask? What's a good way to prepare? I'll probably go in a couple weeks before school starts back up.</p>

<p>A time sensitive exam structure is a weak point for me, so what should I absolutely focus down on?</p>

<p>If they like the exam, that's when I'll get a face-to-face meeting.</p>

<p>An advance thanks goes to everybody who provide their time.</p>
