<p>Hey guys, just had a bug submitted for a site I maintain which heavily uses the viewstate (not my code). However on certain pages when the viewstate is extra bloated Safari is throwhing the usual "Validation of viewstate MAC failed" error.</p>

<p>Any ideas?? Only happens in Safari, Firefox, IE, Opera all fine.</p>
