<p>What is your primary development machine - a Desktop or a laptop?  Why?
Do you use both - if so, do you use source control to keep them synched?</p>

<p>This might seem like a dumb question but I'm on the steep part of the learning curve &amp; I'd be interested in your insights.</p>

<p>[edit] - Using a laptop assumes hanging an Imax-sized screen off it when it is docked. Using a desktop assumes 2x Imax screens.
[edit] - This is faster than Twitter! IDE is VS2008 - laptop is 17 (or 15) inch, 1920x1200</p>
