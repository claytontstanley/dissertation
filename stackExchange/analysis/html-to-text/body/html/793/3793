<p>What's the best way to get the contents of the mixed "body" element in the code below?  The element might contain either XHTML or text, but I just want its contents in string form.  The XmlElement type has the InnerXml property which is exactly what I'm after.</p>

<p>The code as written <em>almost</em> does what I want, but includes the surrounding &lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt; element, which I don't want.</p>

<pre><code>XDocument doc = XDocument.Load(new StreamReader(s));
var templates = from t in doc.Descendants("template")
                where t.Attribute("name").Value == templateName
                select new
                {
                   Subject = t.Element("subject").Value,
                   Body = t.Element("body").ToString()
                };
</code></pre>
