<p>Hi,</p>

<p>Recently I tried understanding the use of <strong>java.math.MathContext</strong> but failed to understand properly. Is it used for rounding in java.math.BigDecimal, if yes why does not it round the decimal digits but even mentissa part.</p>

<p>From API docs, I came to know that it follows the standard specified in ANSI X3.274-1996 and ANSI X3.274-1996/AM 1-2000 specifications but I did not get them to read online.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any idea on this.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
