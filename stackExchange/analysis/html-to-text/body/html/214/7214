<p>I'm currently tasked with replacing an Apache + Resin Java web server with a Resin-only configuration.</p>

<p>Currently in our apache setup, we use .htaccess and a small user database to provide passwording at a directory level.</p>

<p>Does anyone know the equivalent setup when using just Resin as the web server?</p>
