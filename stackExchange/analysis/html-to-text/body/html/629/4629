<p>I can do an <code>eval("something()");</code> to execute the code dynamically in JavaScript. Is there a way for me to do the same thing in C#?</p>

<p>What I am exactly trying to do is that I have an integer variable (say i) and I have multiple properties by the names: "Property1","Property2","Property3" etc.
Now, I want to perform some operations on the " Property<em>i</em> " property depending on the value of i. </p>

<p>This is really simple with Javascript. Is there any way to do this with C#?</p>

<p>Edit: Oh, and I am using C# 2.0</p>
