<p>Last year we were focused on improve our technical capacities and leveraging our knowledge of various architectures and frameworks and methodologies. </p>

<p>This year (August mark the start of a new accounting year) we need to improve our productivity. By this I don't means we need to get more KLOCs per month per programmer. What we need is to get more artifacts finished, stables, and returning in the promised market value. </p>

<p>For artifacts I refer to every deliverable product that we produce as part of a given project: </p>

<ul>
<li>Software programs</li>
<li>Automatized Test Cases</li>
<li>User's Manuals</li><li>
</li><li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you tell what things are improved your performance as solo programmer or as a member of a heterogeneous team?</p>
