<p>Hey all, <br>
I've been trying to get pretty charts to work in GWT on our internal network. <br>
Playing around with <a href="http://gwt-ext.com" rel="nofollow">GWT-Ext</a>'s charts is nice, but it requires flash and is really messy to control (it seems buggy, in general). <br>
I'd like to hear about something that works with the least amount of dependencies and it also must work without a connection to the web (so, Google' charts API isn't a solution).</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Indeed, I would rather a library that is all client-side.</p>

<p>Thank you all!</p>
