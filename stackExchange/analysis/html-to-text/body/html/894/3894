<p>Given the constraint of only using T-Sql in Sql Server 2005, is there a better way to remove the decimal point from a money datatype than a conversion to a varchar (here implicitly) and then a replace of the decimal point?</p>

<p>Here is what I have currently.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT REPLACE(1.23, '.', ''), REPLACE(19.99, '.', '')<br></code></pre>

<p>Which returns the desired 123 and 1999, but I was wondering if there was a better way.  Any thoughts?</p>
