<P>As a long time World of Warcraft player, and a passionate developer I have decided that I would like to combine the two and set about developing some addins. Not only to improve my gameplay experience but as a great opportunity to learn something new.</P>
<P>Does anyone have any advice on how to go about starting out?</P>
<P>Is there an IDE one can use? How does one go about testing? Are there any ready made libraries available? Or would I get a better learning experience by ignoring the libraries and building from scratch? How do I oneshot Hogger?</P>
<P>Would love to hear your advice, experiences and views.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>
