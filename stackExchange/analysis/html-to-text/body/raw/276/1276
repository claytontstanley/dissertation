<p>At what point does a MySQL database start to lose performance?</p>

<ul>
<li>Does physical database size matter?</li>
<li>Do number of records matter?</li>
<li>Is any performance degradation linear or exponential?</li>
</ul>

<p>Ive got (what I believe to be) a large database, almost 2GB and about 15M records. Should I be cleaning this out, or am I OK for another few years?</p>
