<p>I'm currently evaluating the MSF for CMMI process template under TFS for use on my development team, and I'm having trouble understanding the need for separate bug and change request work item types.  I understand that it is beneficial to be able to differentiate between bugs (errors) and change requests (changing requirements) when generating reports.  In our current system, however, we only have a single type of change request and just use a field to indicate whether it is a bug, requirement change, etc (this field can be used to build report queries).  What are the benefits of having a separate workflow for bugs?  I'm also confused by the fact that developers can submit work against a bug <strong>or</strong> a change request -- I thought the intended workflow was for bugs to generate change requests which are what the developer references when making changes.</p>
