<p>Most mathematicians agree that e ** (Ï€i) + 1 = 0. However, most floating point implementations disagree. How well can we settle this dispute?</p>

<p>I'm keen to hear about different languages and implementations, and various methods to make the result as close to zero as possible. Be creative!</p>
