<p>Suppose I have the following CSS rule in my HTML.</p>

<pre>body { font-family:Calibri,Trebuchet MS,Helvetica,sans-serif; }</pre>

<p>How can I detect which one of the defined fonts was used in the user's browser?</p>

<p>Edit for people wondering why I want to do this: The font I am detecting contains glyphs not available in other fonts and when the user does not have it I want to display a link asking the user to download that font so they can use my web application.</p>

<p>Currently I am displaying the download font link for all users, now I can only display it for people who do not have the correct font installed.</p>
