  boy how I hate CSS! it's an art that I have no clue about! Spend hours making everything look dandy then you look at the same site in a different browser... WT... I though this was supposed to be a standard!!

<p>What I really want is a WYCIWYG editor. No not dreamweaver! An editor where you can define an element and immediately see it's effect on screen more importantly drag it around the screen.</p>

<p>Even better is an editor that ( somehow ) allows you to draw elements around the screen. That would be a real editor!</p>

<p>On top of this I would like it to auto fix up all the browser specific poo so that it looks the same in all popular browsers ( I just don't want to think / worry about it ).</p>

<p>btw I am not a designer, I'm a programmer forced into there world :(</p>
