<P>I'm developing a data access component that will be used in a website that contains a mix of classic ASP and ASP.NET pages, and need a good way to manage its configuration settings. I'd like to use a custom ConfigurationSection, and for the ASP.NET pages this works great. But when the component is called via COM interop from a classic ASP page, the component isn't running in the context of an ASP.NET request and therefore has no knowledge of web.config.</P>
<P>Is there a way to tell the ConfigurationManager to just load the configuration from an arbitrary path (e.g. "..\web.config" if my assembly is in the /bin folder)? If there is then I'm thinking my component can fall back to that if the default ConfigurationManager.GetSection returns null for my custom section.</P>
<P>Any other approaches to this would be welcome!</P>
