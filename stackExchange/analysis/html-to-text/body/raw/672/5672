<p>What are folks out there using for web/ui design?  For the most part we use PowerPoint at my company.  The UI folks will mock up a screen in PowerPoint and we (the development group) will take it from there.  So, for a side gig of mine I decided to do some mock ups to show the client prior to dev and I'm quickly feeling that PowerPoint is not the right tool for this.  </p>

<p>What are you using for this type of stuff - some other software?  pen/paper?  </p>
