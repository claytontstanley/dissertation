<p>Currently I know of only two ways to cache data (I use PHP but I assume that the same will apply to most languages).</p>

<ol>
<li>Save the cache to a file</li>
<li>Save the cache to a large DB field</li>
</ol>

<p>Are there any other (perhaps better) ways of caching or is it really just this simple?</p>
