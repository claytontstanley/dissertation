<p>For all the RSS feeds I subscribe to I use <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/" rel="nofollow">Google Reader</a> which I love. I do however have a couple of specific RSS feeds that I'd like to be notified as soon as when they get updated (say for example a RSS feed for a forum I like to monitor and respond to as quick as possible). </p>

<p>Are there any tools out there for this kind of monitoring and that has some kind of alert functionality (a prompt window for example)? </p>

<p>I've tried <a href="http://www.simbolic.net/software/RSSAlert/" rel="nofollow">Simbolic RSS Alert</a> but I found it a bit buggy and couldn't get it to alert my as often as I liked.</p>

<p>Suggestions? Different experience of Simbolic? </p>
