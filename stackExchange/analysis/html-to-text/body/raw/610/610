<p>Alright, this is a rather odd question that doesn't have one true answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the <strong>* Best || Easiest to Use || Most Powerful || Cleanest *</strong> GUI API or library (tk, SWING, Qt, etc.) you have had the privilege to use?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've had conversations with friends about how annoying <em>XYZ API</em> was to deal with and how someone could build a better one, and I was curious what other's thoughts were on the subject.  Is there a good and straightforward way to implement a GUI from the programmer's standpoint, and has someone done it yet?</p>
