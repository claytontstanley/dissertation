<p>My PC has had trouble recently but now it won't boot into windows. I put in a new HDD and reinstalled windows but now I want to get the info off the old HDD.</p>

<p>What linux distro can allow me to read and possibly repair my old hard drive? I've used Knoppix a while back and it was good, but is there something I can download that is much smaller than 700MB? The distro should have NTFS write abilities too.</p>
