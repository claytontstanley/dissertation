<p>My company is using me as a sort of guinea pig for having developers on both sides of the US. The main office is located in Denver, and I'm in Louisville, KY. I've been trying to come up with ideas to make the remote development experience line up better with the experience in the main office. It obviously will never line up perfectly, but I think we can still make it better. </p>

<p>For reference, we work primarily in Java with Eclipse being the preferred IDE.</p>

<p>So far I've come up with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Instant Messaging/Skype - Can act as both a basic in/out/busy system and a quick communication system.</li>
<li>Development Portal - A simple web page with links to important documentation or references for packages we use in each project and any other useful information.</li>
<li>Cruise Control - So we don't waste as much time pulling down and then worrying about broken builds.</li>
<li>VNC - For the times I want to show someone code that has no business being checked into Git yet, or when I need to walk through a series of screens for critique/advice.</li>
</ul>

<p>What other tools are available that we can use to help me feel less like I'm stranded on a desert island?</p>
