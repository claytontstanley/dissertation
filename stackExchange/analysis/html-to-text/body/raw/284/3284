<p>I've been working with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479030.aspx" rel="nofollow">providers</a> a fair bit lately, and I came across an interesting situation where I wanted to have an abstract class that had an abstract static method. I read a few posts on the topic, and it sort of made sense, but is there a nice clear explanation?</p>
