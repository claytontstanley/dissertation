<p>Hi Folks,</p>

<p>I have a Microsoft keyboard with a series of non-standard buttons such as "Mail", "Search" , "Web/Home" etc.</p>

<p>It would be nice to be able to bind these keys so they execute arbitrary programs.</p>

<p>Does anybody know how to do this in Debian Etch?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Simon</p>
