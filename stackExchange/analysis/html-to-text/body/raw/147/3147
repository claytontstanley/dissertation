<p>I have seen these being used every which way, and have been accused of using them the wrong way (though in that case, I was using them that way to demonstrate a <a href="http://blog.gadodia.net/extension-methods-in-vbnet-and-c/" rel="nofollow">point</a>).</p>

<p>So, what do you think are the best practices for employing Extension Methods?</p>

<p>Should development teams create a library of extension methods and deploy them across various projects?</p>

<p>Should there be a collection of common extension methods in the form of an open source project?</p>

<p><em>Update: have decided to create an organization wide extension methods library</em> </p>
