<p>Does anybody have some good templates (or links to) that they use for software lifecycle documents (feasibility, concept, requirements, architecture)? </p>

<p>I've taken some old ones I've had from school and slimmed them down a bit since none of the current projects that I work on are to that scale, but they always feel somewhat clugey. Sadly enough there isn't any kind of lifecycle support here at my current job, so I don't have anything here to base mine on.</p>
