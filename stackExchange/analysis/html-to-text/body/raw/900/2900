<p>I am getting the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Access denied for user 'apache'@'localhost' (using password: NO)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php<br><br>include("../includes/connect.php");<br><br>$query = "SELECT * from story";<br><br>$result = mysql_query($query) or die(mysql_error());<br><br><br><br>echo "&lt;h1&gt;Delete Story&lt;/h1&gt;";<br><br>if (mysql_num_rows($result) &gt; 0) {<br>    while($row = mysql_fetch_row($result)){<br>          echo '&lt;b&gt;'.$row[1].'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="../process/delete_story.php?id='.$row[0].'"&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;';<br>      echo '&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;'.$row[2].'&lt;/i&gt;';<br>    }<br>}<br>else {<br>   echo "No stories available.";<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>The connect.php file contains my MySQL connect calls that are working fine with my INSERT queries in another portion of the software.  If I comment out the $result = mysql_query line, then it goes through to the else statement.  So, it is that line or the content in the if.</p>

<p>I have been searching the net for any solutions, and most seem to be related to too many MySQL connections or that the user I am logging into MySQL as does not have permission.  I have checked both.  I can still perform my other queries elsewhere in the software, and I have verified that the account has the correct permissions.</p>

<p>I think I just need an outside perspective as I have been staring at this little block of code all day.</p>

<p>If any more information is needed, just let me know.</p>
