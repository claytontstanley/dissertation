<p>I’ve got a lot of PDFs/CHMs and they are getting out of control. So I’ve decided to do something about it. First I hit Google and didn’t get very far - the range of programs are very naff. Then I hit <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/" rel="nofollow">metafilter</a> and got a lot more results. From there I learnt there is a lot of programs that do exactly what I want, look stylish and some are even free, but unfortunately they are all written for the Mac, except one that doesn’t do what I want (it does it all online I want it offline).</p>

<p>All I want is a program that you can point at a directory and that will plow through them and list your documents. It can make guesses at content by keyword and the list the abstract (if it has one of course) and allow me to tag it. For instance, does the PDF book <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/utc2/pragmatic-unit-testing-in-c-with-nunit-2nd-ed" rel="nofollow">Pragmatic Unit Testing in C#</a> belong in Unit Testing folder, the C# folder or the Pragmatic Bookshelf folder? It doesn’t it belongs in all three.</p>

<p>Apparently iTunes does what I want it to, but I don’t want to install a music program to organize my PDF’s - it doesn’t seem right…</p>

<p>Your suggestions?</p>
