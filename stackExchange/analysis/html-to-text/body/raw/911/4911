<p>So in my simple learning website, I use the built in ASP.NET authentication system. </p>

<p>I am adding now a user table to save stuff like his zip, DOB etc'. My question is:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the new table, should the key be the user name (the string) or the user ID which is that GUID looking number they use in the asp_ tables. </li>
<li>If the best practice is to use that ugly guid, anyone knows how to get it? it seems to not be accessible as easily as the name (System.Web.HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.Name)</li>
<li>If you suggest I use neither (not the guid nor the userName fields provided by ASP.NET authentication) then how do I do it with ASP.NET authentication? One option I like is to use the email address of the user as login, but how to I make ASP.NET authentication system use an email address instead of a user name? (or there is nothing to do there, it is just me deciding I "know" userName is actually an email address?</li>
</ol>

<p>Please note:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am not asking on how to get a GUID in .NET, I am just refering to the userID column in the asp_ tables as guid.</li>
<li>The user name is unique in ASP.NET authentication</li>
</ul>
