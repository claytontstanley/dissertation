<p>We recently discovered that the Google Maps API does not play nicely with SSL.  Fair enough, but what are some options for overcoming this that others have used effectively?</p>

  <p>At this time, the Maps API is not
  available over a secure (SSL)
  connection. If you are running the
  Maps API on a secure site, the browser
  may warn the user about non-secure
  objects on the screen.</p>

<p>We have considered the following options</p>

<ol>
<li>Splitting the page so that credit card collection (the requirement for SSL) is not on the same page as the Google Map.</li>
<li>Switching to another map provider, such as Virtual Earth.  Rumor has it that they support SSL.</li>
<li>Playing tricks with IFRAMEs.  Sounds kludgy.</li>
<li>Proxying the calls to Google.  Sounds like a lot of overhead.</li>
</ol>

<p>Are there other options, or does anyone have insight into the options that we have considered?</p>
