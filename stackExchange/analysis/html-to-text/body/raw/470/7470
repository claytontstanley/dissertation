<p>After a couple hours fighting with the <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/" rel="nofollow">Gallery2</a> <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:Modules:rss" rel="nofollow">RSS module</a> and getting only the message, "no feeds have yet been defined", I gave up.  Based on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22no+feeds+have+yet+been+defined%22" rel="nofollow">a Google search for "no feeds have yet been defined"</a>, this is a pretty common problem.  Do you have any tips and/or tricks for getting the Gallery2 RSS module to work?  Or any tips for a relatively-PHP-ignorant developer trying to debug problems with this PHP application?</p>
