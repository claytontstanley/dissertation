<p>I'd like to be able to test a function with a tuple from a set of fringe cases and normal values. For example, in testing a function that returns true when given three lengths that form a valid triangle, I'd have specific cases, negative numbers, small numbers, large numbers, values close-to being overflowed, etcetera. Then generating combinations of these values, <em>with</em> or <em>without</em> repetition, to get a set of test data.</p>

<p>(inf,0,-1),
(5,10,1000),
(10,5,5),
(0,-1,5),
(1000,inf,inf),
...</p>

<p>(I actually know the answer to this, but it might be helpful for others, and a challenge for people here! --will post my answer(s) later on.)</p>
