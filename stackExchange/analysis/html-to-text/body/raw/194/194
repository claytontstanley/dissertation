<p>Yes, I know.  The existence of a running copy of SQL Server 6.5 in 2008 is absurd.</p>

<p>That stipulated, what is the best way to migrate from 6.5 to 2005?  Is there any direct path?  Most of the documentation I've found deals with upgrading 6.5 to 7.</p>

<p>Should I forget about the native SQL Server upgrade utilities, script out all of the objects and data, and try to recreate from scratch?</p>

<p>I was going to attempt the upgrade this weekend, but server issues pushed it back till next.  So, any ideas would be welcomed during the course of the week.</p>

<p><em>Update.  This is how I ended up doing it:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Back up the database in question and Master on 6.5.</li>
<li>Execute SQL Server 2000's instcat.sql against 6.5's Master.  This allows SQL Server 2000's OLEDB provider to connect to 6.5.</li>
<li>Use SQL Server 2000's standalone "Import and Export Data" to create a DTS package, using OLEDB to connect to 6.5.  This successfully copied all 6.5's tables to a new 2005 database (also using OLEDB).</li>
<li>Use 6.5's Enterprise Manager to script out all of the database's indexes and triggers to a .sql file.</li>
<li>Execute that .sql file against the new copy of the database, in 2005's Management Studio.</li>
<li>Use 6.5's Enterprise Manager to script out all of the stored procedures.</li>
<li>Execute that .sql file against the 2005 database.  Several dozen sprocs had issues making them incompatible with 2005.  Mainly non-ANSI joins and quoted identifier issues.</li>
<li>Corrected all of those issues and re-executed the .sql file.</li>
<li>Recreated the 6.5's logins in 2005 and gave them appropriate permissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>There was a bit of rinse/repeat when correcting the stored procedures (there were hundreds of them to correct), but the upgrade went great otherwise.</p>

<p>Being able to use Management Studio instead of Query Analyzer and Enterprise Manager 6.5 is such an amazing difference.  A few report queries that took 20-30 seconds on the 6.5 database are now running in 1-2 seconds, without any modification, new indexes, or anything.  I didn't expect that kind of immediate improvement.</p>
