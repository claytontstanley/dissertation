<p>I have a potential intern coming in tomorrow for his second interview.  Following Joel Spolsky's advice from "Smart &amp; Get Things Done" this is where we get a little technical and make sure the kid can do the things he says he can do.</p>

<p>We are a ASP.NET, C# (1.1 - 3.5) shop that uses XHTML/CSS, jQuery, SQL Server 2000/2005 primarily for our web sites.</p>

<p>What are some quality technical questions you would ask or assume would get asked on an interview to gauge if you knew your stuff?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> This is for a SECOND interview the candidate already passed a phone interview where he was asked what sites you read to stay on top etc. The purpose of this interview tomorrow is to see if they really have the knowledge.  So I am looking for some questions where they can work through some code on a whiteboard or something.</p>
