<p>I really feel that I should learn Lisp and there are plenty of good resources out there to help me do it.</p>

<p>I'm not put off by the complicated syntax, but where in "traditional commercial programming" would I find places it would make sense to use it instead of a procedural language.</p>

<p>Is there a commercial killer-app out there that's been written in Lisp ?</p>
