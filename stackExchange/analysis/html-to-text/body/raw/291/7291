<p>I'm working on an app that converts source code from using one framework to another.<br />
I really wanted to make the agonizing monotonous job automatic.<br />
After looking a lot for something that code help me treat source code in an object-oriented way and modify it the closest thing I've found was <a href="http://ws.apache.org/jaxme/js/index.html" rel="nofollow" title="Reading List: Fog Creek Software Management Training Program">JaxMeJS</a> and that's short of what I need too.</p>

<p>I've been working at creating my own parser using <a href="http://antlr.org/" rel="nofollow" title="Bootstrap">antlr</a>, but would love not having to do it by myself.</p>

<p>Any recommendations? Of course I'd rather a Java solution, but I have an open mind.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
