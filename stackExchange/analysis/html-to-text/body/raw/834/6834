<p>I would describe myself as a career coder - i.e. a developer at work but never really coded for fun. </p>

<p>Early in my career I've hit the management track though. I really like my current job and can't see me going back to coding anytime soon so:</p>

<p>Whats the best way to develop my coding skills and learn new languages in my spare time?</p>
