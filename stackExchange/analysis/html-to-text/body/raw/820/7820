<p>Can anyone suggest a good guide/tutorial for programming PostgreSQL? By this I mean creating triggers and procedures, domains, new types, using the various languages, and so on.</p>

<p>The manual is good, but I found it lacking as a learning aid (it is more of a reference, as manuals should be)? It is very good at describing the SQL syntax and administration tools, but was not very good at the more advanced features of PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>I have used the forums in the past</p>

<p><a href="http://www.postgresqlforums.com/forums/" rel="nofollow">http://www.postgresqlforums.com/forums/</a></p>

<p>but I think a proper guide or tutorial would be better.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Rereading my question, I see I was not clear enough, I am asking about writing stored procedures/triggers, creating new domains and types and all the higher end stuff. I was not asking about basic SQL and database functions, I was thinking more along the power user lines.</p>

<p><strong>Update (Dec 2008):</strong> I still have not had a whole lot of luck finding anything really. I am currently using the later chapters of the PostgreSQL manual. In the <a href="http://www.twit.tv/floss18" rel="nofollow">FLOSS Weekly episode</a> on PostgreSQL, Josh Berkus spoke of various uses where people have found ways for their server to talk directly to other databases, and various other applications that really sound quite impressive.</p>

<p>Of course, it seems quite plausible that this kind of functionality just is not really documented anywhere.</p>
