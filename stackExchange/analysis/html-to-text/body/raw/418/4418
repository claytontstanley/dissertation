<p>Firewall I'm behind is running Microsoft ISA server (NTLM only mode), anyone have success getting their Ruby gems to install/update via Ruby SSPI gem or other method?</p>

<p>... or am I just being lazy?</p>

<p>Edit: <strong>rubysspi-1.2.4 does not work</strong></p>

<p>UPDATE: This also works for "igem", part of the IronRuby project</p>
