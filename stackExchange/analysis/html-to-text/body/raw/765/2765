<p>I am trying to learn the keyboard shortcuts in Visual Studio in order to be more productive.  So I downloaded a document showing many of the default keybindings in Visual Basic when using the VS 2008 IDE from Microsoft: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=255b8cf1-f6bd-4b55-bb42-dd1a69315833&amp;displaylang=en</p>

<p>But, when I tried what they say is the keyboard shortcut to view all open documents (<strong>CTRL + ALT + DOWN ARROW</strong>) I got a completely unexpected result on my XP machine - my entire screen display was flipped upside down!</p>

<p>Was this a prank by someone at Microsoft?  I can't imagine what practical value this flipping of the screen would have.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what the <em>correct</em> keyboard shortcut is to view all open documents in VS 2008?</p>

<p>Oh and if you try the above shortcut and it flips your display the way it did mine, do a <strong>CTRL + ALT + UP ARROW</strong> to switch it back.</p>
