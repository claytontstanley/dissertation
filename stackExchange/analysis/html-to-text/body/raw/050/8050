<p>During the beta of Stack Overflow, I have seen quite a few questions about LINQ SQL but know nothing about it... it sounds very interesting.</p>

<p><strong>What is LINQ and how do I get started?</strong></p>

<p>Links guides or documentation a bonus :)</p>

<p><em>PS: I am a long time C# developer who daily uses Datatables and Parameterized SQL</em></p>
