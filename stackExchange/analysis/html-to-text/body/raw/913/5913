<p>This gets the value of whatever is selected in my dropdown menu.</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById('newSkill').value
</code></pre>

<p>I cannot however find out what property to go after for the text that's currently displayed by the drop down menu. I tried "text" then looked at <a href="http://w3schools.com/" rel="nofollow">W3Schools</a> but that didn't have the answer, does anybody here know?</p>

<p>For those not sure, here's the HTML for a drop down box.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select name="newSkill" id="newSkill">
    &lt;option value="1">A skill&lt;/option>
    &lt;option value="2">Another skill&lt;/option>
    &lt;option value="3">Yet another skill&lt;/option>
&lt;/select>
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks</p>
