<p>I'm currently experimenting with build script, and since I have an ASP.net Web Part under source control, my build script should do that at the end:</p>

<ol>
<li>Grab the "naked" Windows 2003 IIS VMWare or Virtual PC Image from the Network</li>
<li>Boot it up</li>
<li>Copy the Files from the Build Folder to the Server</li>
<li>Install it</li>
<li>Do whatever else is needed</li>
</ol>

<p>I have never tried automating a Virtual Machine, but I saw that both VMWare and Virtual Server offer automation facilities. While I cannot use Virtual Server (Windows XP Home :-(), Virtual PC works.</p>

<p>Does anyone here have experience with either VMWare Server or Virtual PC 2007 SP1 in terms of automation?</p>

<p>Which one is better suited (I run windows, so the Platform-independence of VMWare does not count) and easier to automate?</p>
