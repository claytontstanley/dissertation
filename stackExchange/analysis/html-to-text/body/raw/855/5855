<p>I've found many sources that talk about the automated Eclipse PDE process.  I feel these sources don't do a good job explaining what's going on.</p>

<p>I can create the deployable package, in a semi-manual process via the Feature Export.  </p>

<p>The automated process requires knowledge of how the org.eclipse.pde.build scripts work.  I have gotten a build created, but not for JNLP.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Has anyone ever deployed RCP through JNLP?</li>
<li>Were you able to automate the builds?</li>
</ol>
