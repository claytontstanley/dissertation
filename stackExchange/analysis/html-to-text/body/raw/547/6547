<p>One of those classic programming interview questions...</p>

<p>You are given two marbles, and told that they will break when dropped from some certain height (and presumably suffer no damage if dropped from below that height). Youâ€™re then taken to a 100 story building (presumably higher than the certain height), and asked to find the highest floor your can drop a marble from without breaking it as efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>Extra info</p>

<ul>
<li>You must find the correct floor (not a possible range)</li>
<li>The marbles are both guaranteed to break at the same floor</li>
<li>Assume it takes zero time for you to change floors - only the number of marble drops counts</li>
<li>Assume the correct floor is randomly distributed in the building</li>
</ul>
