So I know I need to implement version control, even for just the developing I do at home.  My issue is I have read about how great Subversion is for the past couple years.  I was about to dedicate myself to learning this on the side.  But now I am starting to read about Git being the up and coming version control system.
So should I hold of and see which one comes out on top?  Are they both winners in certain areas?
One issue I noticed with Git, is there is not much for a GUI, which is important to me.
Also, wouldn't mind suggestions on how to get started with one or the other. (tutorials, etc.)
