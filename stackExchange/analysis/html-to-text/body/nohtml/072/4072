I just did a merge using something like:
svn merge -r 67212:67213 https://my.svn.repository/trunk .
I only had 2 files, one of which is a simple ChangeLog.  Rather than just merging my ChangeLog changes, it actually pulled mine plus some previous ones that were not in the destination ChangeLog.  I noticed there was a conflict when I executed --dry-run, so I updated ChangeLog, and there was STILL a conflict (and I saw the conflict when I did the actual merge).
I then later diffed on the file I was merging from:
svn diff -r 67212:67213 ChangeLog
And I see just the changes I had made, so I know that extra changes didn't get in there somehow.
This makes me worried that merge is not actually just taking what I changed, which is what I would have expected.  Can anybody explain what happened?
UPDATE: In response to NilObject:
So, I have 2 files changed, only ChangeLog is relevant, the other merged fine.  When I go to my regular trunk checkout, I do the diff command above and see:
Index: ChangeLog

After my merge of the previous changes, the diff of ChangeLog looks like this:

Note that the entry that was incorrectly pulled in was not in the file I am merging it to, but yet it was not one of my changes and shouldn't have been merged anyways.  It was easy to fix (remove the extra lines that weren't part of my changes), but it still makes me worry about merging automatically in SVN.
