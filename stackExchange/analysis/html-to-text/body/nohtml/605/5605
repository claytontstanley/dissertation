I recently discovered the org-mode in emacs and it works very well for me. I also like www.RememberTheMilk.com. I would like to be able to sync my org-mode file and RTM list. I know that RTM has its API exposed as web services. I am currently looking for a HTTP library that I could use to write my script. I found a couple of links but I am still not entirely satisfied.

Any pointers in doing web service interactions with emacs would be very useful. Also please keep in mind that I'm not a seasoned emacs expert. I have broken the initial barriers of emacs and can find my way around elisp. So, be gentle. :-)
