Hi guys! As anyone ever assisted the CSLA Master Class from Rockford Lhotka? ( www ).
It seems a good way to enforce my OO knowledge in the asp.net field, but since I have to consider the flight to Atlanta and the course's price ($ 2.500), I'm not convinced yet.
Also, I could barrely find any feedback on the web.
Could anyone share some experience or comments?
Thanks a lot.
