Is there a trivial, or at least moderately straight-forward way to generate territory maps (e.g. Risk)?
I have looked in the past and the best I could find were vague references to Voronoi diagrams.  An example of a Voronoi diagram is here .
These hold promise, but I guess i haven't seen any straight-forward ways of rendering these, yet alone holding them in some form of data structure to treat each territory as an object.
Another approach that holds promise is flood fill, but again I'm unsure on the best way to start with this approach.
Any advice would be much appreciated.
