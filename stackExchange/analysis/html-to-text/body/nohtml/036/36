How can I monitor a MSSQL database for changes to a table without using triggers or modifying the structure of the database in any way?  My preferred programming environment is .Net and C#

I'd like to support MS SQL 2000 SP4 or higher
by "changes to a table" I mean changes to table data, not changes to table structure.
Ultimately, I would like the change to trigger an event in my application, instead of having to check for changes at an interval.
