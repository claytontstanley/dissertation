Which of the following has the best performance?
I have seen method two implemented in JavaScript with huge performance gains, however, I was unable to measure any gain in C# and was wondering if the compiler already does method 2 even when written like method 1.
The theory behind method 2 is that the code doesn't have to access DataTable.Rows.Count on every iteration, it can simple access the int c.
Method 1
for (int i = 0; i < DataTable.Rows.Count; i++) {     // Do Something }
Method 2
for (int i = 0, c = DataTable.Rows.Count; i < c; i++) {     // Do Something }
