I already know the basics of RegEx but I'm not sure where to go from here, I'm looking for both a good and above all easy to understand guide but I am also looking for things to use RegEx's for, it's all well and good reading about it but if you never use them then they will not stick in your mind.
I have already found regular-expressions.info but I'm sure there are more.
