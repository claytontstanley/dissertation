Can anybody recommend some good portable apps for development?  I'd prefer not to deal with U3, but what I'm hoping for is an IDE/editor with code completion and syntax highlighting.
Edit:
Notepad++ appears to have completion and some other awesome features. I think I'm going to give that a shot.
Thanks, Greg!
