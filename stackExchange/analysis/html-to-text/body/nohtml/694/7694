Is that even a valid question? I have a .Net windows app that is using MSTDC and it throwing an exception:
System.Transactions.TransactionManagerCommunicationException:   Network access for Distributed   Transaction Manager (MSDTC) has been   disabled. Please enable DTC for   network access in the security   configuration for MSDTC using the   Component Services Administrative tool --->   System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x8004D024): The   transaction manager has disabled its support for remote/network   transactions. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8004D024)      at   System.Transactions.Oletx.IDtcProxyShimFactory.ReceiveTransaction(UInt32   propgationTokenSize, Byte[] propgationToken, IntPtr managedIdentifier,   Guid& transactionIdentifier, OletxTransactionIsolationLevel& isolationLevel, ITransactionShim& transactionShim)....
I follow the guide here to able MSTDC on the pc, on which the app is installed. But the error still occurs. I was wondering if this was a DB issue? And if so how can i resolve it?
