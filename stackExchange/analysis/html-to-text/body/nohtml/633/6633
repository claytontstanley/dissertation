I have inherited some legacy PHP code what was written back when it was standard practice to use register_globals. We know now that it is bad for security to have it enabled. The problem is how do I find all the places in the code where I need to use $_GET or $_POST? My only thought was to set the error reporting to warn about uninitialized variables and then test each part of the site. Is there an easier way? Will I have to test each code path in the site or will PHP give a warnings on a file basis?
