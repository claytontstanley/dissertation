As most Web developers know, IE6 is a pain to support when it comes to making a website look and feel just as in the other major browsers (Firefox and IE7). I'd like to know what are the feelings of other developers toward supporting IE6 on their websites.
Of course if your main user base uses IE6 or if you're working for a client that requires you to make it work in IE6, you don't even ask, but what about a web blog for example?
