For people who work on very small teams, or by themselves, or on teams where they are by far the best developer and have a need to learn from someone better than them, are there any online resources/methods for doing some sort of peer code review?
I used to be pretty active in the online art community (specifically drawing anime) and there were all sorts of sites where you could just post pictures for critiques and comments. I've never seen anything like that for programmers. I'm thinking of somewhere where you could post Object Architecture plans, DB design plans, or even just straight code for others to look at, learn from, and critique and comment on. Anyone know of anything like that anywhere (preferably focused towards PHP, but anything will do, and even a non-free site would be ok)?
Thanks!
note: yes, I am aware that this could have security implications, but security by obscurity is the worst security, and posting your code would actually help flush out potential security issues...
