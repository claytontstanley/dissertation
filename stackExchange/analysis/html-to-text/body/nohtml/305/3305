I'm not trying to start a "which language is better" argument here, so please don't go there.
I typically use PHP for most of my web development (mostly because hosting is cheap), but for various reasons I'm looking to use ASP.NET for a couple new projects.  But one of the major reasons I've stayed away from ASP.NET up until now is the cost.  I've seen some budget hosting options, but they always seem a little sketchy to me.  From what I've generally found, that's just the way the hosting scene looks for ASP.NET unless you want to go dedicated.
Does anyone have any good suggestions for a solid ASP.NET host with a good feature set and reliability for my money?  Also, are there any options out there along the lines of Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud? And yes, I know... Mono.  I'm talking about Windows based "grid" hosting options?
