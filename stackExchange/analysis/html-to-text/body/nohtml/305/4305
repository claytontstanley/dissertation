Are there any good grid-hosting companies out there that offer .NET stacks? Something like MediaTemple - which won't host the worlds fastest websites, but for the price is far better than "shared hosting". I've used Rackspace's Mosso, but it sucked - it never felt like a normal .NET stack (caching was odd, site recompilation was odd).
