Attempting to insert an escape character into a table results in a warning. For example:
create table EscapeTest (text varchar(50));  insert into EscapeTest (text) values ('This is the first part \n And this is the second');
Produces the warning:
WARNING:  nonstandard use of escape in a string literal
(Using PSQL 8.2)
Anyone know how to get around this?
