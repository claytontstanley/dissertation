I use AnkhSVN and Visual Studio 2005 and 2008. Now, one thing that bugs me is that Ankh does not really work with ASP.NET sites. I cannot add them properly to a repository and it won't detect changes, especially because the site is on a remote server accessed through Frontpage Extensions (File => Open Site).
What are the alternatives? Does a better plug-in exist? Manually downloading the files through FTP and using TortoiseSVN or svn.exe is not really the level of integration I want :) I want to stay within the Visual Studio IDE when possible. Also, I do not control the remote Server, so I can not install anything on it, which means the whole change tracking/comparison to repository has to be done on my machine.
