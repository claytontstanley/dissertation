I've been using Subversion for a few years and after using SourceSafe , I just love Subversion.  Combined with TortoiseSVN , I can't really imagine how it could be any better.
Yet there's a growing number of developers claiming that Subversion has problems and that we should be moving to the new breed of distributed version control systems, such as Git .
How does Git improve upon Subversion?
