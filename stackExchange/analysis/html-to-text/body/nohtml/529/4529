Has anyone tried installing SQL Server 2008 Developer on a machine that already has 2005 Developer installed?
I am unsure if I should do this, and I need to keep 2005 on this machine for the foreseeable future in order to test our application easily. Since I sometimes need to take backup files of databases and make available for other people in the company I cannot just replace 2005 with 2008 as I suspect (but do not know) that the databases aren't 100% backwards compatible.
What kind of issues would arise? Do I need to install the new version with an instance name, will that work? Can I use a different port number to distinguish them?

It doesn't say more than just yes you can do this and I kinda suspected that this was doable anyway, but I need to know if there are anything I need to know before I start installing.
Anyone?
