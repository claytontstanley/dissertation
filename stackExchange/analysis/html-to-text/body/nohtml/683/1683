I am looking for the spiritual guidance of what is the best practice around the use of Profile feature in ASP.NET.
How do you decide what should be kept in the built in user Profile, or if you should just go and create your own DB Table and add a column for that? For example, a user has a zip code, should I save the zip code in my own table, or should I add it to the web.config xml profile and then access it via the user profile ASP.NEt mechanize?
The pros/cons I can think of are that since I don't know the profile so well, (it is a bit of a Matrix right now) I probably can do whatever I want if I go the table route (like, SQL to get all the users in the same zip code as the current user), I don't know ifI can do the same if I use the ASP.NET profile.
