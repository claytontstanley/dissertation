Over the past few years I've changed from having a long flowing page of controls that I hid/showed to using a lot of user controls. I've always had a bit of a discussion between co-workers on best practices.
Should you have properties that you populate, or use paramterized sub's to load the information in your controls?
Part of my fear of using paramteter's is the fact that I cannot make sure that everything will be populated.
What is the basic rule's for using interfaces? I've never created one. And should I try this, or stay with a "sub load"?
