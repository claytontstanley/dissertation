When you execute a SQL query, you have to clean your 'strings' or users can execute malicious SQL on your website.
I usually just have a function escape_string(blah), which:
Replaces escapes () with double escapes (\).
Replaces single quotes (') with an escaped single quote (\').
Is this adequate? Is there a hole in my code? Speedy library to reliably do this for me?
I'd like to see graceful solutions in:
Perl
Java
PHP
