At work we have a 2 X 4 24 inch monitor video wall served by a single Mac Pro with a bunch of video cards. It's an architectural feature of the office and not a particularly good way to use those nice 24 inch dells.
We mostly put a few of our websites on some screens and run gltail on some for watching traffic. Sometimes we tail -f error logs.
My question is this: what other pretty log analyzers except gltail are there? All those bouncing balls in gltail seem to slow down the rendering significantly, and it seems impossible to turn it off. What other things we can stick on there?
You'd be surprised as to how useful this thing is - yesterday we noticed that one of the three virtual servers was a lot slower than usual. It was still up and serving and because of that did not trip our monitoring, but was slow enough to warrant a restart.
