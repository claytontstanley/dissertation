I work in a software development environment with many teams working on many projects. Over the next year I have set a goal of making those around me more passionate about the industry of software. I've started by increasing general awareness of industry news and events, encouraging team-mates to blog, hosting brown-bag (lunch'n'learn) sessions.
What else do people suggest that I try?
