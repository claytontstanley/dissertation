During the beta of Stack Overflow, I have seen quite a few questions about LINQ SQL but know nothing about it... it sounds very interesting.
What is LINQ and how do I get started?
Links guides or documentation a bonus :)
PS: I am a long time C# developer who daily uses Datatables and Parameterized SQL
