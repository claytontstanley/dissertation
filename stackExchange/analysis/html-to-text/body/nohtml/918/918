I have been dabbling in Python for a couple months now, read the online docs/tutorial and started playing with Django a bit as well... and I feel like I am starting to leave my formative toddler years and ready for some more serious code. Most everything I see is generally encapsulated in a single script or so large and unwieldy I don't know where to start.
I would really like to see an excellent example of some proper Python code, style, organization etc. and ideally a WHY associated with some of those decisions. Any ideas for where I should look next? I would prefer a simple console app with at most just a few extra .py files (maybe one package for good measure)...
Oh, and one more thing: The reason this is coming up is I have quite a bit of experience in Java and .NET where it is generally preferred to have one class definition per source file. That rarely seems to be the case in the python world (at least in my very limited exposure) and it just doesn't smell right to me. So maybe this is more Enterprise Python that hobbyist python or something.
