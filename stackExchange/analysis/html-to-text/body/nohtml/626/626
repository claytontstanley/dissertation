In Ruby 1.8, there are subtle differences between proc/lambda on the one hand, and Proc.new on the other.
What are those differences?
Can you give guidelines on how to decide which one to choose?
In Ruby 1.9, proc and lambda are different. What's the deal?
Edit
@Mike Stone: there's no difference between 1.8 and 1.9 in this regard.
@Accordeon Guy: that's the difference I had in mind, but I don't think it's the whole story. What about next/break/return in procs? What about Ruby 1.9? What about scopes, and returning procs from a method?
