Alright, so I've always wanted to write myself a nice little Game of Life program where you could play with the rules and adjust the number of cells and such; I've just never really had the time to mess around to do this (until recently).  I understand the basic algorithm and such (if you don't, go to the Game of Life Wikipedia page to check it out.) but only have a little experience with GUI programming.  I'm considering doing this in python, but I was really wanting to figure out how to go about doing this in general, so feel free to give code snippets in your language of choice.
To summarise:
How would you go about programming a "Conway's Game of Life" simulation in your language of choice?
