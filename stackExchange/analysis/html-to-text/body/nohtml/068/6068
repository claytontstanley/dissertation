I'm looking for good suggestions on how to implement version and source control for web projects.
I've looked into subversion, but it seems to only take care of code.  I'm really looking for something that can do good version-ing, branching, archival, etc. with not only source code, but other web assets like art files, movie clips, and even database backups.
We work in a mixed mac/pc environment, so Visual Source Safe or anything purely PC based would be a no go.  Any help?
