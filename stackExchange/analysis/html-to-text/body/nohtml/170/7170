Although I have quite a few years of experience of building web applications in Java, I've not really done much web development in the more lightweight 'LAMP' style.
I've recently picked up python and am quite liking what I see so far, but there isn't an 'obvious' choice for which web framework to use, as it seems there are a number of well-used options.
While I'd like to have a nice rich framework to use, I would prefer a framework that was accessible rather than one that "did a lot of code for me".  Mainly because if I then need to customise something, I need to get involved in a lot of that boilerplate code.
So given this thinking, what would be the best option for Python web development?
