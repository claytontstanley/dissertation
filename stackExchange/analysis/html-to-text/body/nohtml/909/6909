Last year we were focused on improve our technical capacities and leveraging our knowledge of various architectures and frameworks and methodologies.
This year (August mark the start of a new accounting year) we need to improve our productivity. By this I don't means we need to get more KLOCs per month per programmer. What we need is to get more artifacts finished, stables, and returning in the promised market value.
For artifacts I refer to every deliverable product that we produce as part of a given project:
Software programs
Automatized Test Cases
User's Manuals
etc
Can you tell what things are improved your performance as solo programmer or as a member of a heterogeneous team?
