What tools will I need for creating a podcast and what things should I keep in mind when recording? With the tools, please suggest Windows, Mac and Unix tools :)
I'm aware that monotones are a really bad idea, what about quiet background music, is it good or bad?
Edit: How is this related to programming? I want to create a podcast about something programming related and with the very varied knowledge bases here it seems a good place to ask.
