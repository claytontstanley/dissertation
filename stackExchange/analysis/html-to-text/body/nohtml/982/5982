Does anyone know why when using BindingUtils on the selectedItem property of a ComboBox you get the following warning? Any ideas how to resolve the issue?
The binding still works properly, but it would be nice to get rid of the warning.
warning: multiple describeType entries for 'selectedItem' on type 'mx.controls::ComboBox':
<accessor name="selectedItem" access="readwrite" type="Object" declaredBy="mx.controls::ComboBase">
<metadata name="Bindable">
<arg key="" value="valueCommit"/>
</metadata>
...
Thanks,
Matt
