So a windows exe file has access to the command string which invoked it, including its path and filename. eg. "C:\MyApp\MyApp.exe --help".
But this is not so for a dll invoked via LoadLibrary. Does anyone know of a way for a dll to find out what its path and filename is?
Specifically I'm interested in a Delphi solution, but I suspect that the answer would be pretty much the same for any language.
