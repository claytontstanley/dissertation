Any suggestions for a relatively simple, free, WYSIWYG, HTML editor? I have a friend in need of a art portfolio website and I want to her feet wet without forcing her to learn raw HTML or an overly complex (and probably expensive) program.
Extra points if somehow this free editor is OSS
UPDATE:
sorry, still drinking my coffee
Windows-based, running locally S he knows enough to zip it up and get it to me. We'll save SFTP for a later date
This probably doesn't affect anything but, I will be hosting the site as well (LAMP setup)
