I see so many people using their laptops on the plane.
Half of them watch movies/listen to music/use it for entertainment.
But then there's the other half that has spreadsheets/documents/planners/productivity software opened up. I can't help but wonder how do they get anything done in such an uncomfortable environment?
Note: I'm talking about Economic class, Business class can be a comfortable place to use a laptop
Is flight-time productive for you?
