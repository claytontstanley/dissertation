#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
unsigned long long int num = 285212672; //FYI: fits in 29 bits
int normalInt = 5;
printf("My number is %d bytes wide and its value is %ul. A normal number is %d.\n", sizeof(num), num, normalInt);
return 0;
}
Output:
My number is 8 bytes wide and its value is 285212672l. A normal number is 0.
I assume this unexpected result is from printing the unsigned long long int. How do you printf an unsigned long long int?
