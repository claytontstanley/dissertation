Form Based Authentication For Websites
Please help us create the definitive resource for this topic. We believe that stackoverflow should not just be a resource for very specific technical questions, but also for general guidelines on how to solve variations on common problems. "Form Based Authentication For Websites" should be a fine topic for such an experiment.
It should include topics such as:
how to log in
how to remain logged in
how to store passwords
using secret questions
forgotten password functionality
OpenID
"Remember me" checkbox
Browser autocompletion of usernames and passwords
secret urls (public urls protected by digest)
checking password strength
email validation
and much more
It should not include things like:
roles and authorization
http basic authentication
