Original Question: Should I Learn C?
In the theme of the stackoverflow podcast, here's a fun question: should I learn C?  I expect Jeff & Joel will have something to say on this.
Some info on my background:
Primarily a Java programmer on "enterprisy" systems.
Favorite languages: python, scheme
7 years programming experience
A very small amount of C++ experience, practically no C experience
No immediate "need" to learn C
So should I learn C?  If so, why?  If not, why?
C or Assembly?
Lots of folks recomending Assembler, so add on question: Is it better to learn C or Assembler? If Assembler, which one?
Recommended assemblers so far:
Motorolla 68000
Intel Assembler (does he mean x86?)
MASM32
