Can a LINQ enabled app run on a machine that only has the .NET 2.0 runtime installed?
In theory, LINQ is nothing more than syntactic sugar, and the resulting IL code should look the same as it would have in .NET 2.0.
How can I write LINQ without using the .NET 3.5 libraries? Will it run on .NET 2.0?
