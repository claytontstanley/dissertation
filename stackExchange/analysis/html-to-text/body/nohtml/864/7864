As I learn more and more about OOP, and start to implement various design patterns, I keep coming back to cases where people are hating on Active Record .
Often, people say that it doesn't scale well (citing Twitter as their prime example) -- but nobody actually explains why it doesn't scale well; and / or how to achieve the pros of AR without the cons (via a similar but different pattern?)
Hopefully this won't turn into a holy war about design patterns -- all I want to know is **specifically** what's wrong with Active Record.
If it doesn't scale well, why not?
What other problems does it have?
