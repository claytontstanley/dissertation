For all the RSS feeds I subscribe to I use Google Reader which I love. I do however have a couple of specific RSS feeds that I'd like to be notified as soon as when they get updated (say for example a RSS feed for a forum I like to monitor and respond to as quick as possible).
Are there any tools out there for this kind of monitoring and that has some kind of alert functionality (a prompt window for example)?
I've tried Simbolic RSS Alert but I found it a bit buggy and couldn't get it to alert my as often as I liked.
Suggestions? Different experience of Simbolic?
