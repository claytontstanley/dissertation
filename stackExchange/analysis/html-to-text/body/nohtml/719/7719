Is there any way to capture the MouseDown even from the .NET 2.0 TextBox control? I know the inherited Control class has the event, but it's not exposed in TextBox. Is there a way to override the event handler?
I also tried the OpenNETCF TextBox2 control which does have the MouseDown event exposed, but no matter what I do, it doesn't fire the handler.
Any suggestions?
