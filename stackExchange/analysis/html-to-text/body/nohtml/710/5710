My desktop PC gets bogged down as a web server, database, code repository and file server. I would like to buy a small PC to offload these duties and have it on 24/7. I was thinking of buying an ASUS EEE Box when they come out. I wouldn't mind building my own but most low power PCs seem quite pricey. Any suggestions?
