Here on Stack Overflow, I would like to be able to use the tab key within the WMD editor text box to tab over 4 spaces. The way it is now, the tab key jumps my cursor down to the Tags.

Is there some JavaScript that will capture the TAB key in the text box before it bubbles up to the UI?
I understand some browsers (i.e. FireFox) may not allow this. How about a custom key-combo like Shift-TAB, or Ctrl-Q?
