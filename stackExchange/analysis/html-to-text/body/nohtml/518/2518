I have 2 SQLite databases, one downloaded from a server (server.db), and one used as storage on the client (client.db). I need to perform various sync queries on the client database, using data from the server database.
For example, I want to delete all rows in the client.db tRole table, and repopulate with all rows in the server.db tRole table.
Another example, I want to delete all rows in the client.db tFile table where the fileID is not in the server.db tFile table.
In SQL Server you can just prefix the table with the name of the database. Is there anyway to do this in SQLite using Adobe Air?
