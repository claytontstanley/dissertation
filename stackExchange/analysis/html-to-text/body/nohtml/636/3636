I'll soon be starting a company with a friend. There will be several parts of it where we work on the same section of a site and as far as I can forsee, the potential for muck-ups is huge.
It's just two people so do we really need to use a version control system and are there any suggestions that you can give in helping us work as a more seamless team?
