Alright, so maybe I shouldn't have shrunk this question sooo much... I have seen the post on the most efficient way to find the first 10000 primes .  I'm looking for all possible ways.  The goal is to have a one stop shop for primality tests.  Any and all tests people know for finding prime numbers are welcome.
And so:
What are all the different ways of finding primes?
