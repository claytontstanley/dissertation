I want to get started doing some game development using Microsoft's XNA. Part of that is Shader development, but I have no idea how to get started. I know that nVidia's FX Composer is a great tool to develop shaders, but I did not find much useful and updated content on how to actually get started.
What tutorials would you recommend?
