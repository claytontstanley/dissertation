Is there a way of mapping data collected on a stream or array to a data structure or vice-versa? In C++ this would simply be a matter of casting a pointer to the stream as a data type I want to use (or vice-versa for the reverse) eg: in C++
Mystruct * pMyStrct = (Mystruct*)&SomeDataStream; pMyStrct->Item1 = 25;  int iReadData = pMyStrct->Item2;
obviously the C++ way is pretty unsafe unless you are sure of the quality of the stream data when reading incoming data, but for outgoing data is super quick and easy.
Strange... my previously accepted answer was unaccepted. anyway, while all the given solutions were helpful, the accepted answer is the one I was looking for
