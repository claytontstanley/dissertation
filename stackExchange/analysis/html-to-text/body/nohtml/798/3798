Currently I have two Linux servers running MySQL, one sitting on a rack right next to me under a 10 Mbit/s upload pipe (main server) and another some couple of miles away on a 3 Mbit/s upload pipe (mirror).
I want to be able to replicate data on both servers continuously, but have run into several roadblocks. One of them being, under MySQL master/slave configurations, every now and then, some statements drop (!), meaning; some people logging on to the mirror URL don't see data that I know is on the main server and vice versa. Let's say this happens on a meaningful block of data once every month, so I can live with it and assume it's a "lost packet" issue (i.e., god knows, but we'll compensate).
The other most important (and annoying) recurring issue is that, when for some reason we do a major upload or update (or reboot) on one end and have to sever the link, then LOAD DATA FROM MASTER doesn't work and I have to manually dump on one end and upload on the other, quite a task nowadays moving some .5 TB worth of data.
Is there software for this? I know MySQL (the "corporation") offers this as a VERY expensive service (full database replication). I am just wondering what people out there do. The way it's structured, we run an automatic failover where if one server is not up, then the main URL just resolves to the other server.
