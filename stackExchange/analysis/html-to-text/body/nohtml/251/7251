I'm a tech-minded dev. I analyze, design, code and debug - and I'm good at it. On the other hand, I'm not that good with people, especially those who I think are slacking off or not put enough effort into learning new things. Also, I'm highly competitive and usually stubborn. This probably closes the management door for me - I'm not good at it, and I don't like it.
However, I've rarely seen anyone advancing in this track beyond "activity leader or "technical leader" in a team, and the pyramid get's a lot narrower than it does in management.
What tracks are available to a person like me? How can I keep "climbing the ladder", meeting new challenges with in rising scale of difficulty? I'm afraid that I'll reach a peak where I'd look ahead and say "it's not worth going in there - either I've done it (tech) or I don't want to (mgmt)". What tracks are you people on?
(Sorry if I come off an as an arrogant egomaniac)
