If this isn't the type of fodder that belongs on StackOverflow, feel free to bury this question.  I figured technical presentations are something that most of us do, and God knows we've all attended plenty, so I thought I'd get your feedback.
I'm preparing for a technical presentation, and am wondering if I could get away with simple, elegant slides.  No bullets, small amounts of text that represent the high level point I'm trying to get across.  No bullets, no titles, just simple.
After watching DHH's presentation at startup school, though not technical, I found it a pretty elegant presentation deck, and it kept my focus on what he was saying.
Can you get away with that in a technical presentation, or does the audience need to see more?
