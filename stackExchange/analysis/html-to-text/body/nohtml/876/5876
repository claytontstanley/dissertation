I use dnsmasq to resolve DNS queries on my home network. Unfortunately, if a domain name is not known, it will append my own domain name to the request which means that I always end up viewing my own site in a browser.
For example, if I enter http://dlksfhoiahdsfiuhsdf.com in a browser, I end up viewing my own site with that URL. If I try something like:
host dlksfhoiahdsfiuhsdf.com
Instead of the expected:
Host dlksfhoiahdsfiuhsdf.com not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
I get this:
dlksfhoiahdsfiuhsdf.com.mydomainname.com has address W.X.Y.Z.
Clearly, dnsmasq is appending my domain name to impossible name requests in an effort to resolve them, but I'd rather see the not found error instead.
I've tried playing with the expand-hosts and domain configuration settings, but to no avail. Is there anything else I can try?
