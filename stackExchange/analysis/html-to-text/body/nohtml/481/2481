I've been able to find details on several self-balancing BSTs through several sources, but I haven't found any good descriptions detailing which one is best to use in different situations (or if it really doesn't matter). Specifically, I want a BST that is optimal for storing in excess of ten million nodes. The order of insertion of the nodes is basically random, and I will never need to delete nodes, so insertion time is the only thing that would need to be optimized. I indend to use it to store previously visited game states in a puzzle game, so that I can quickly check if a previous configuration has already been encountered.
