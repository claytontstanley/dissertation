Background: I am working as a freelance web-developer. Now, lately this has meant that I have to design a lot of graphic images, logos etc for the the websites I create.
So, are there any good resources to learn these things? And, what softwares should I ideally be learning? I have always heard about Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop being the frontrunners. Is it worth my time to learn these two 'huge' softwares?
