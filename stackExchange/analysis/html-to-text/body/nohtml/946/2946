Finally I get to post my ı's and İ's as promised...
I've found that MS Indexing Service returns incomplete results when searching for documents with Turkish content. It seems to choke especially regarding the (incorrectly-named) 4I problem .
Apparently, MS has fixed this problem with a Windows 2000 http://support.microsoft.com/kb/325333 service pack, but the bug seems to be resurrected with Windows XP & 2003.
Anybody uses Indexing Service in their line of work? Similar problems with other non-English locales? Any solutions?
