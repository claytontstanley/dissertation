I am looking to allow users to control of subdomain of an app I am toying with, much like Basecamp where it is 'customusername.seework.com'.
What is required on the DNS end to allow these to be created dynamically and be available instantly.
And how do you recommend dealing with this in the logic of the site? Htaccess rule to  lookup the subdomain in the DB?
thanks
