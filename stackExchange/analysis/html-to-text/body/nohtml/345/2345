When I started with .net I really got into podcasts/screencasts as it's an engaging way to learn and it's nice to hear other people passionate about software. So what can everyone contribute to this list? Hopefully this will turn into a nice list so others wont have to go rummaging around as much. I'll start by posting my two fave ones, but please remember that I'd love to add media for other languages/technology.
General Goodness
Two experienced software developers talk about their joint venture and general topics in the world of software development. http://blog.stackoverflow.com/
Host Markus Voelter interviews software professionals on a variety of aspects of software development. http://www.se-radio.net/
.net related
A podcast focused on, obviously, .net technology, I'm pretty sure this is the most widely known podcast for .net http://www.dotnetrocks.com/
A screencast very closely tied to .net Rocks with one of the hosts! Almost all of the episodes there is an interviewee on the show who will demonstrate techniques/showoff a particular technology. http://www.dnrtv.com/
