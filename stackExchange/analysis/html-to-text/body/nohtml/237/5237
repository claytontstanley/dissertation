At work, we are often working on multiple branches of our product at one time. For example, right now, we have a maintenance branch, a branch with code just going to QA, and a branch for a new major initiative, that won't be merged for some time now.
Our web project is set up to use IIS, so every time we switch to a different branch, we have to go in to IIS Admin and change the path on the virtual directory, then reset IIS, and sometimes even restart Visual Studio, to avoid getting build errors.
Is there any way to simplify this, other than not having our web project set up as a virtual directory? I'm not sure we want to make that change at this point.  What do you do to make this easier, assuming you do this?

@RedWolves, virtual machines would definitely work, but I'm not sure it would be any simpler, especially for some of the other developers on my team, which is partly why I'm looking for more simplicity.
@Dan, we're not able to change source control providers, unfortunately.
@pix0r, that's something I'll try when I get back to work.  Thanks for the suggestion.
@Haacked, I'll have to give that a try too, but I think we have some issues with why that won't work (I can't remember exactly why right now; this application was originally written in .Net 1.1, pre-Cassini, and I can't remember if we tried it when we upgraded to 2.0 or not).
Thanks all for the responses so far.
