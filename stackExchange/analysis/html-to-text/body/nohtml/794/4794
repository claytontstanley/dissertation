I've written (most of) an application in Flex and I am concerned with protecting the source code. I fired up a demo of Trillix swf decompiler and opened up the swf file that was installed to my Program Files directory. I saw that all of the actionscript packages I wrote were there. I'm not too concerned with the packages, even though there is a substantial amount of code, because it still seems pretty unusable without the mxml files. I think they are converted to actionscript, or atleast I hope. However, I would still like to explore obfuscation.
Does anyone have any experience with Flash / Actionscript 3 / Flex obfuscators? Can you recommend a good product?
