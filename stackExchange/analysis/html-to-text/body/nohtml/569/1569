I'm an experienced programmer in C/C++, Java and PHP and I've recently become interested in learning ASP.NET.  I'm looking for a book geared toward someone who already knows web development (I don't need to relearn HTML and CSS) and programming that will dive into using ASP.  Also, a book that teaches ASP development using Visual Studio and Windows Server 2008 would be great.
I found Beginning ASP.NET 3.5: In C# and VB by Imar Spaanjaars but it goes into too much depth on the simple stuff... maybe there's something better?
Bonus points if it's available on books24x7.com. :D
