I noticed as a JR programmer, bright eyed and excited about new technologies, is the serious amount of loathing Windows developers have for Windows platform.  It's starting to take it's toll.  Really.
My question is: How do you deal with the constant carcinogen?  Especially when you are afraid to publicly disagree with EVERYONE on your team.
How do you say "NO, give me a Vista box"  and "NO, the problem isn't Vista it's the fact this dependency we have hasn't been updated ... no hasn't been COMPILED since 2004 and was written for Windows ME".
I'm in it for the love of the game, not the money, but some days I want to wait tables instead. I swear, being a punk rocker getting eggs thrown at me, I had more self respect.
Note:  I don't want to start a religious "M$ suxor!!11one" debate, we all know there are some things that could be better.  I'm trying to avoid such things in the work place and really don't want to get involved with it here.  Though a thought out constructive motivator for some other platform is welcome.
