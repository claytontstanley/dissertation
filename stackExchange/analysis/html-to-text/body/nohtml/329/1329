I need to copy hundreds of gigs of random files around on my computer and am pretty leery of using the vanilla file copy built into Windows.
I don't want it to hang on a "Are you sure?", "Are you really sure?", "Even zip files?", "Surely not read-only files too!" loop as soon as I step away.
I don't want it to work for hours and then stop unexpectedly: "Someone once opened this file and so I won't copy it!" and then cancel the whole copy or just quit with no indication of what was done and what work remains.
What file management programs do you have experience with?  Which do you recommend?
This question is related to my other question: How can I use an old PATA hard disk drive on my newer SATA-only computer?
