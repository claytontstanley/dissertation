I am getting the following error:
Access denied for user 'apache'@'localhost' (using password: NO)
When using the following code:
<?php
include("../includes/connect.php");
$query = "SELECT * from story";
$result = mysql_query($query) or die(mysql_error());
echo "<h1>Delete Story</h1>";
if (mysql_num_rows($result) > 0) {
while($row = mysql_fetch_row($result)){
echo '<b>'.$row[1].'</b><span align="right"><a href="../process/delete_story.php?id='.$row[0].'">Delete</a></span>';
echo '<br /><i>'.$row[2].'</i>';
}
}
else {
echo "No stories available.";
}
The connect.php file contains my MySQL connect calls that are working fine with my INSERT queries in another portion of the software.  If I comment out the $result = mysql_query line, then it goes through to the else statement.  So, it is that line or the content in the if.
I have been searching the net for any solutions, and most seem to be related to too many MySQL connections or that the user I am logging into MySQL as does not have permission.  I have checked both.  I can still perform my other queries elsewhere in the software, and I have verified that the account has the correct permissions.
I think I just need an outside perspective as I have been staring at this little block of code all day.
If any more information is needed, just let me know.
