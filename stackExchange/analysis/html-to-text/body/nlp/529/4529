has
anyone
tried
installing
sql
server
2008
developer
on
a
machine
that
already
ha
2005
developer
installed
?
i
am
unsure
if
i
should
do
this
,
and
i
need
to
keep
2005
on
this
machine
for
the
foreseeable
future
in
order
to
test
our
application
easily
.
since
i
sometimes
need
to
take
backup
file
of
database
and
make
available
for
other
people
in
the
company
i
can
not
just
replace
2005
with
2008
a
i
suspect
(
but
do
not
know
)
that
the
database
are
n't
100
%
backwards
compatible
.
what
kind
of
issue
would
arise
?
do
i
need
to
install
the
new
version
with
an
instance
name
,
will
that
work
?
can
i
use
a
different
port
number
to
distinguish
them
?
i
found
this
entry
on
technet
:

&
siteid=17
it
doe
n't
say
more
than
just
yes
you
can
do
this
and
i
kinda
suspected
that
this
wa
doable
anyway
,
but
i
need
to
know
if
there
are
anything
i
need
to
know
before
i
start
installing
.
anyone
?
