i
'm
trying
to
setup
cruisecontrol.net
at
the
moment
.
so
far
it
work
nice
,
but
i
have
a
problem
with
the
msbuild
task
.
according
to
the
documentation
,
it
pass
ccnetartifactdirectory
to
msbuild
.
but
how
do
i
use
it
?
i
tried
this
:
<
buildargs
>
/noconsolelogger
/p
:
outputpath=
$
(
ccnetartifactdirectory
)
\test
<
/buildargs
>
but
that
doe
not
work
.
in
fact
,
it
kill
the
service
with
this
error
:
thoughtworks.cruisecontrol.core.config.preprocessor.evaluationexception
:
reference
to
unknown
symbol
ccnetartifactdirectory
documentation
is
rather
sparse
,
and
google
und
mainly
offer
modifying
the
.sln
project
file
,
which
is
what
i
want
to
avoid
in
order
to
be
able
to
manually
build
this
project
later
-
i
would
really
prefer
/p
:
outputpath
.
