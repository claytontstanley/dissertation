i
've
been
lucky
enough
to
have
been
employed
for
a
while
now
but
face
the
prospect
of
a
job
search
in
the
next
month
or
so
.
i
know
monster
and
careerbuilder
are
wasted
cesspool
for
head-hunters
,
scammer
and
spammer
,
so
where
is
a
good
place
to
spend
time
posting
a
resume
and
reading
serious
listing
?
if
it
help
,
i
'm
a
not-quite-senior
level
dev
looking
for
something
product
focused
rather
than
consulting
.
