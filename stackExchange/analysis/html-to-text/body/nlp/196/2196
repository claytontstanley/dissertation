i
've
got
an
web
application
that
i
'm
trying
to
optimise
.
some
of
the
control
are
hidden
in
dialog-style
divs
,
so
i
'd
like
to
have
them
load
in
via
ajax
only
when
the
user
want
to
see
them
.
this
is
fine
for
control
that
are
mostly
literal-based
(
various
menu
and
widget
)
,
but
when
i
have
what
i
call
``
dirty
''
control
-
one
that
write
extensive
information
to
the
viewstate
,
put
ton
of
css
or
script
on
the
page
,
require
lot
of
reference
etc
-
these
are
seemingly
impossible
to
move
``
out
of
page
''
,
especially
considering
how
asp.net
will
react
on
postback
.
i
wa
considering
some
kind
of
step
where
i
override
render
,
find
marker
for
the
bit
i
want
to
move
out
and
put
ajax
placeholder
in
there
,
but
not
only
doe
the
server
overhead
seem
extreme
,
it
also
feel
like
a
complete
hack
.
besides
,
the
key
element
here
is
the
dialog
box
that
contain
form
with
validation
control
on
them
,
and
i
ca
n't
imagine
how
i
would
move
the
control
and
their
required
script
.
in
my
fevered
imagination
,
i
want
to
do
this
:
ajaxifier.ajaxify
(
ctleditform
)
;
sadly
,
i
know
this
is
a
dream
.
how
close
can
i
really
get
to
quick-and-easy
ajaxification
without
causing
too
much
load
on
the
server
?
