i
've
opened
an
old
workspace
that
is
a
libray
and
it
test
harness
.
it
used
to
work
fine
but
now
doe
n't
and
older
version
of
the
code
do
n't
work
either
with
the
same
error
.
i
've
tried
recreating
the
project
and
that
cause
the
same
error
too
.
nothing
seems
out
of
order
in
project
setting
and
the
code
generated
work
in
the
main
app
.
i
've
stripped
out
most
of
the
file
and
got
it
down
to
the
bare
minimum
to
generate
the
error
.
unfortunately
i
ca
n't
post
the
project
a
this
is
used
in
production
code
.
the
lnk2001
linker
error
i
get
usually
mean
i
've
left
off
a
library
or
forgot
to
implement
a
virtual
function
.
however
this
is
part
of
the
standard
template
library
-
and
is
a
header
at
that
.
the
code
that
is
listed
a
having
the
problem
in
iocompletionport.obj
doe
n't
actually
use
std
:
:string
directly
,
but
doe
call
a
class
that
doe
:
comms
:
:exception
accepts
a
std
:
:string
and
the
value
of
getlasterror
or
wsagetlasterror
.
the
function
mentioned
in
the
error
(
getmessage
)
is
implemented
,
but
is
a
virtual
function
so
other
class
can
override
it
if
need
be
.
however
it
appears
that
the
compiler
ha
made
it
a
an
ansi
version
,
but
i
ca
n't
find
any
option
in
the
setting
that
would
control
that
.
i
suspect
that
might
be
the
problem
but
since
there
's
very
little
in
the
way
of
option
for
the
library
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
for
sure
.
however
both
project
to
specify
_mbcs
in
the
compiler
option
.
