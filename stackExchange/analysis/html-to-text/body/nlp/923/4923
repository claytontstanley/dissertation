i
'm
using
clodfusion
(
sic
)
to
populate
a
template
that
includes
html
list
(
<
ul
>
's
)
.
most
of
these
are
n't
that
long
,
but
a
few
have
ridiculously
long
length
and
could
really
stand
to
be
in
2-3
columns.
is
there
an
html
,
coldfusion
or
perhaps
javascript
(
i
have
jquery
available
)
way
to
do
this
easily
?
it
's
not
worth
some
over-complicated
heavy
weight
solution
to
save
some
scrolling
.
