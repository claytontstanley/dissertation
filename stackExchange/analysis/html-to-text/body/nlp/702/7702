if
this
is
n't
the
type
of
fodder
that
belongs
on
stackoverflow
,
feel
free
to
bury
this
question.
i
figured
technical
presentation
are
something
that
most
of
u
do
,
and
god
know
we
've
all
attended
plenty
,
so
i
thought
i
'd
get
your
feedback.
i
'm
preparing
for
a
technical
presentation
,
and
am
wondering
if
i
could
get
away
with
simple
,
elegant
slides.
no
bullet
,
small
amount
of
text
that
represent
the
high
level
point
i
'm
trying
to
get
across.
no
bullet
,
no
title
,
just
simple.
after
watching
dhh
's
presentation
at
startup
school
,
though
not
technical
,
i
found
it
a
pretty
elegant
presentation
deck
,
and
it
kept
my
focus
on
what
he
wa
saying.
can
you
get
away
with
that
in
a
technical
presentation
,
or
doe
the
audience
need
to
see
more
?
