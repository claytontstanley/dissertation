is
it
possible
to
access
an
element
on
a
master
page
from
the
page
loaded
within
the
contentplaceholder
for
the
master
?
i
have
a
listview
that
list
people
's
name
in
a
navigation
area
on
the
master
page
.
i
would
like
to
update
the
listview
after
a
person
ha
been
added
to
the
table
that
the
listview
is
data
bound
to
.
the
listview
currently
doe
not
update
it
's
value
until
the
cache
is
reloaded
.
we
have
found
that
just
re-running
the
listview.databind
(
)
will
update
a
listview
's
content
.
we
have
not
been
able
to
run
the
listview.databind
(
)
on
a
page
that
us
the
master
page
.
below
is
a
sample
of
what
i
wanted
to
do
but
a
compiler
error
say
``
peoplelistview
doe
not
exist
in
the
current
context
''
.
gis.master
-
where
listview
resides
...
<
asp
:
listview
id=
''
peoplelistview
''
...
gisinput_people.aspx
-
uses
gis.master
a
it
's
master
page
gisinput_people.aspx.cs
addnewperson
(
)
{
//
add
person
to
table
...
.
//
update
person
list
peoplelistview.databind
(
)
;

}
what
would
be
the
best
way
