i
've
been
working
on
a
project
that
access
the
wmi
to
get
information
about
the
software
installed
on
a
user
's
machine
.
we
've
been
querying
win32_product
only
to
find
that
it
doe
n't
exist
in
64-bit
version
of
windows
because
it
's
an
``
optional
component
''
.
i
know
there
are
a
lot
of
really
good
alternative
to
querying
the
wmi
for
this
information
,
but
i
've
got
a
bit
of
a
vested
interest
in
finding
out
how
well
this
is
going
to
work
out
.
what
i
want
to
know
is
if
there
's
some
kind
of
redistributable
that
can
be
packaged
with
our
software
to
allow
64-bit
user
to
get
the
wmi
installer
provider
put
onto
their
machine
?
right
now
,
they
have
to
install
it
manually
and
the
installation
requires
they
have
their
windows
disc
handy
.
thanks
,
everyone
.
edit
:
you
did
n't
mention
for
what
os
,
but
the
wmi
redistributable
components
version
1.0
definitely
exists
.
for
operation
system
,
we
've
been
using
.net
3.5
so
we
need
package
that
will
work
on
xp64
and
64bit
version
of
windows
vista
.
