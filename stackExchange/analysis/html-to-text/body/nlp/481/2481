i
've
been
able
to
find
detail
on
several
self-balancing
bsts
through
several
source
,
but
i
have
n't
found
any
good
description
detailing
which
one
is
best
to
use
in
different
situation
(
or
if
it
really
doe
n't
matter
)
.
specifically
,
i
want
a
bst
that
is
optimal
for
storing
in
excess
of
ten
million
nodes.
the
order
of
insertion
of
the
node
is
basically
random
,
and
i
will
never
need
to
delete
node
,
so
insertion
time
is
the
only
thing
that
would
need
to
be
optimized.
i
indend
to
use
it
to
store
previously
visited
game
state
in
a
puzzle
game
,
so
that
i
can
quickly
check
if
a
previous
configuration
ha
already
been
encountered
.
