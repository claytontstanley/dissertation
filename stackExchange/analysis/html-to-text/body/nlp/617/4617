we
've
got
two
developer
on
the
same
closed
(
ugh
,
stupid
gov
)
network
,
another
developer
a
couple
minute
drive
down
the
road
,
and
a
fourth
developer
half-way
across
the
country.
e-mail
,
ftp
,
and
removal
medium
are
all
possible
method
of
transfer
for
the
people
not
on
the
same
network.
i
am
one
of
the
two
closed
network
developer
,
consider
u
the
``
master
''
location.
what
is
the
best
mercurial
setup/pattern
for
group
?
what
is
the
best
way
to
trasmit
change
to/from
the
remote
developer
?
as
i
am
in
charge
,
i
figured
that
i
would
have
to
keep
at
least
one
master
repo
with
another
local
repo
in
which
i
can
develop.
each
other
person
should
just
need
a
clone
of
the
master.
is
this
right
?
i
guess
this
also
make
me
responsible
for
the
merging
?
as
you
can
see
,
i
'm
still
trying
to
wrap
my
head
around
distributed
version
control.
i
do
n't
think
there
is
any
other
way
to
do
this
with
the
connectivity
situation
.
