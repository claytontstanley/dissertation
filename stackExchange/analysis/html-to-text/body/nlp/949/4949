we
have
a
php
project
that
we
would
like
to
version
control
.
right
now
there
are
three
of
u
working
on
a
``
dev
''
version
of
the
project
that
all
have
our
eclipse
linked
to
it
with
just
an
external
folder
,
and
thus
no
version
control
.
what
is
the
right
way
,
and
what
is
the
best
way
,
to
version
control
this
(
not
necessarily
the
same
i
dont
think
)
we
have
a
svn
set
up
but
just
need
to
find
a
good
way
to
check
in
and
check
out
that
let
u
test
on
the
dev
server
.
any
idea
?
