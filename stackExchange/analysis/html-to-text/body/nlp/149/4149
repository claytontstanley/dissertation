i
have
an
application
that
writes
information
to
file
.
this
information
is
used
post-execution
to
determine
pass/failure/correctness
of
the
application
.
i
'd
like
to
be
able
to
read
the
file
a
it
is
being
written
so
that
i
can
do
these
pass/failure/correctness
check
in
realtime
.
i
assume
it
is
possible
to
do
this
,
but
what
are
the
gotchas
involved
when
using
java
.
if
the
reading
catch
up
to
the
writing
,
will
it
just
wait
for
more
writes
up
until
the
file
is
closed
?
or
will
the
read
throw
an
exception
at
this
point
and
then
what
do
i
do
?
my
intuition
is
currently
pushing
me
towards
bufferedstreams
.
is
this
the
way
to
go
?
