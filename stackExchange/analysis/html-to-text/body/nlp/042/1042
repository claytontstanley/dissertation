for
instance
,
my
query
is
like
the
following
using
sql
server
2005
:
select
*
from
table
where
freetext
(
searchfield
,
'c
#
'
)
i
have
a
full
text
index
defined
to
use
the
column
searchfield
which
return
result
when
using
:
select
*
from
table
where
searchfield
like
'
%
c
#
%
'
i
believe
#
is
a
special
letter
,
so
how
do
i
allow
freetext
to
work
correctly
for
the
query
above
?
