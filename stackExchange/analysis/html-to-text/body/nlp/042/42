i
am
starting
a
new
web
application
in
php
and
i
this
time
around
i
want
to
create
something
that
people
can
extend
by
using
a
plug-in
interface.
i
am
a
very
confident
php
developer
however
i
have
never
done
this
before
so
i
'm
not
really
sure
where
to
start.
how
doe
one
go
about
writing
'hooks
'
into
their
code
so
that
plug-in
can
attach
to
specific
event
?
