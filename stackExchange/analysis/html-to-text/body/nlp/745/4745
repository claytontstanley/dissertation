for
any
of
you
that
have
used
asp.net
mvc
(
especially
the
stack
overflow
team
)
,
do
you
think
it
's
worth
taking
the
plunge
with
a
technology
that
's
still
in
``
preview
''
release
,
not
even
beta
yet
?
from
what
i
've
seen
on
the
mvc
site
and
various
blog
,
it
seems
that
a
lot
is
still
in
flux
,
making
it
so
that
upgrading
to
the
latest
mvc
version
would
likely
require
a
lot
of
code
changes.
compared
to
webforms
,
is
it
worth
getting
the
mvc
model
at
the
expense
of
likely
having
to
do
re-writes
later
just
to
comply
with
the
latest
version
?
i
ask
this
especially
in
term
of
doing
something
that
will
be
used
,
not
just
if
i
should
try
it
out
.
