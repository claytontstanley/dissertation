i
've
been
doing
asp.net
development
for
a
little
while
now
,
and
i
've
used
both
the
gridview
and
the
datagrid
control
before
for
various
thing
,
but
i
never
could
find
a
really
good
reason
to
use
one
or
the
other
.
i
'd
like
to
know
:
what
is
the
difference
between
these
2
asp.net
control
?
what
are
the
advantage
or
disadvantage
of
both
?
is
one
any
faster
?
newer
?
easier
to
maintain
?
the
intellisense
summary
for
the
control
doe
n't
seem
to
describe
any
difference
between
the
two
.
they
both
can
view
,
edit
,
and
sort
data
and
automatically
generate
column
at
runtime
.
edit
:
visual
studio
2008
no
longer
list
datagrid
a
an
available
control
in
the
toolbox
.
it
is
still
available
(
for
legacy
support
i
assume
)
if
you
type
it
in
by
hand
though
.
