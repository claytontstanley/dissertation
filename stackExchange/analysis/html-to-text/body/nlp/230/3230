i
'm
wondering
how
to
make
a
release
build
that
includes
all
necessary
dll
file
into
the
.exe
so
the
program
can
be
run
on
a
non-development
machine
without
it
having
to
install
the
microsoft
redistributable
on
the
target
machine
.
without
doing
this
you
get
the
error
message
that
the
application
configuration
is
not
correct
and
to
reinstall
.
