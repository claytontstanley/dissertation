i
'm
developing
some
cross
platform
software
targeting
mono
under
visual
studio
and
would
like
to
be
able
to
build
the
installers
for
windows
and
linux
(
ubuntu
specifically
)
with
a
single
button
click
.
i
figure
i
could
do
it
by
calling
cygwin
from
a
post-build
event
,
but
i
wa
hoping
for
at
best
a
visual
studio
plugin
or
at
worst
a
more
windows-native
way
of
doing
it
.
it
seems
like
the
package
format
is
fairly
simple
and
this
must
be
a
common
need
.
edit
:
re-asked
question
under
other
account
due
to
duplicate
login
issue
.
