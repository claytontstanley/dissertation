i
'm
writing
a
cms
application
in
php
and
one
of
the
requirement
is
that
it
must
be
able
to
interface
with
the
customer
's
exchange
server
.
i
've
written
up
this
functionality
a
few
time
before
and
have
always
used
webdav
to
do
it
,
but
now
i
'm
leaning
away
from
that
.
i
will
be
running
the
site
on
iis
or
apache
(
no
preference
)
on
windows
server
2008
.
a
few
thing
i
would
need
to
do
include
adding
contact
to
a
given
user
's
address
book
,
sending
email
a
a
given
user
and
running
report
on
contact
for
a
user
.
all
of
this
is
pretty
easy
to
do
with
webdav
,
but
if
there
is
a
better
way
that
doe
n't
require
any
functionality
that
is
likely
to
be
deprecated
any
time
soon
.
any
idea
?
update
:
justin
,
i
love
the
idea
of
using
com
object
,
i
just
worry
about
maintaining
a
3rd
product
to
make
everything
work
...
john
,
i
can
write
a
web
service
in
c
#
to
interface
with
for
these
function
and
access
it
with
my
php
app
,
but
it
's
also
a
little
bit
out
of
the
way
.
so
far
,
i
'm
not
100
%
convinced
that
either
of
these
is
better
than
webdav
...
can
anyone
show
me
where
i
'm
being
silly
?
thanks
,
both
of
you
.
