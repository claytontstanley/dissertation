i
'm
using
subclipse
in
flex
builder
3
,
and
recently
received
this
error
when
trying
to
commit
:
svn
:
checksum
mismatch
for
'/users/redacted/documents/flex
builder
3/path/to/my/file.mxml
'
;
expected
:
'f8cb275de72776657406154dd3c10348
'
,
actual
:
'null'
i
worked
around
it
by
:
committing
all
the
other
changed
file
,
omitting
the
troublesome
one
.
copying
the
content
of
the
trouble
file
to
a
textmate
window
deleting
my
project
in
flexbuilder/eclipse
checking
my
project
out
fresh
from
svn
copying
the
text
of
the
trouble
file
back
in
from
the
textmate
window
committing
the
change
.
it
worked
,
but
i
ca
n't
help
but
think
there
's
a
better
way
.
what
's
actaully
happening
to
cause
the
svn
:
checksum
error
,
and
what
's
the
best
fix
.
maybe
more
important
--
is
this
a
symptom
of
a
greater
problem
?
