what
is
the
best
method
for
executing
ftp
command
from
a
sql
server
stored
procedure
?
we
currently
use
something
like
this
:
exec
master..xp_cmdshell
'ftp
-n
-s
:
d
:
\ftp\ftpscript.xmt
172.1.1.1'
the
problem
is
that
the
command
seems
to
succeed
even
if
the
ftp
ended
in
error.
also
,
the
use
of
xp_cmdshell
requires
special
permission
and
may
leave
room
for
security
issue
.
