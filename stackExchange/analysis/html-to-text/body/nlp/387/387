if
you
had
an
multiple
index
that
covered
only
one
partition
each
.
why
doe
the
same
search
on
different
index
return
result
with
different
score
?
the
result
from
the
different
server
match
exactly
.
i.e
if
i
searched
for
:
name
-
john
smith
dob
-
11/11/1934
partition
0
would
return
a
score
of
0.345
partition
1
would
return
a
score
of
0.337
both
matched
exactly
on
the
name
and
dob
.
