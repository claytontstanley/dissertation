i
see
so
many
people
using
their
laptop
on
the
plane
.
half
of
them
watch
movies/listen
to
music/use
it
for
entertainment
.
but
then
there
's
the
other
half
that
ha
spreadsheets/documents/planners/productivity
software
opened
up
.
i
ca
n't

but
wonder
how
do
they
get
anything
done
in
such
an
uncomfortable
environment
?
note
:
i
'm
talking
about
economic

be
a
comfortable
place
to
use
a
laptop
