so
i
hear
a
lot
of
opinion
about
this
,
and
i
wanted
to
see
if
there
wa
anything
resembling
a
consensus
.
when
is
it
appropriate
to
use
an
unsigned
variable
over
a
signed
one
?
what
about
in
a
for
loop
?
for
(
unsigned
int
i
=
0
;
i
<
something.length
(
)
;
i++
)
{
something
var
=
something.at
(
i
)
;
//
you
get
the
idea
.
}
as
i
said
,
i
hear
a
lot
of
opinion
,
but
not
a
lot
of
consensus
.
i
know
java
doe
n't
have
unsigned
value
,
and
that
must
have
been
a
concious
decision
on
sun
's
part
.
looking
forward
to
hearing
everybody
's
opinion
.
