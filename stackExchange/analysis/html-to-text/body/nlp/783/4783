i
have
a
potential
intern
coming
in
tomorrow
for
his
second
interview.
following
joel
spolsky
's
advice
from
``
smart
&
get
things
done
''
this
is
where
we
get
a
little
technical
and
make
sure
the
kid
can
do
the
thing
he
say
he
can
do.
we
are
a
asp.net
,
c
#
(
1.1
-
3.5
)
shop
that
us
xhtml/css
,
jquery
,
sql
server
2000/2005
primarily
for
our
web
sites.
what
are
some
quality
technical
question
you
would
ask
or
assume
would
get
asked
on
an
interview
to
gauge
if
you
knew
your
stuff
?
update
:
this
is
for
a
second
interview
the
candidate
already
passed
a
phone
interview
where
he
wa
asked
what
site
you
read
to
stay
on
top
etc.
the
purpose
of
this
interview
tomorrow
is
to
see
if
they
really
have
the
knowledge.
so
i
am
looking
for
some
question
where
they
can
work
through
some
code
on
a
whiteboard
or
something
.
