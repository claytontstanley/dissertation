the
.xfdl
file
extension
identifies
xfdl
formatted
document
file
.
these
belong
to
the
xml-based
document
and
template
formatting
standard
.
this
format
is
exactly
like
the
xml
file
format
however
,
contains
a
level
of
encryption
for
use
in
secure
communication
.
i
know
how
to
view
xfdl
file
using
a
file
viewer
i
found
here
.
i
can
also
modify
and
save
these
file
by
doing
file
:
save/save
as
.
i
'd
like
,
however
,
to
modify
these
file
on
the
fly
.
any
suggestion
?
is
this
even
possible
?

i
have
now
successfully
decoded
and
unziped
a
.xfdl
into
an
xml

which
i
can

am
looking
for
a
way
to
re-encode

back
into

(
using
ruby
or

command
line
