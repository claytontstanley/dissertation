i
recently
discovered
the
org-mode
in
emacs
and
it
work
very
well
for
me.
i
also
like
www.rememberthemilk.com.
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
sync
my
org-mode
file
and
rtm
list.
i
know
that
rtm
ha
it
api
exposed
a
web
services.
i
am
currently
looking
for
a
http
library
that
i
could
use
to
write
my
script.
i
found
a
couple
of
link
but
i
am
still
not
entirely
satisfied.

any
pointer
in
doing
web
service
interaction
with
emacs
would
be
very
useful.
also
please
keep
in
mind
that
i
'm
not
a
seasoned
emacs
expert.
i
have
broken
the
initial
barrier
of
emacs
and
can
find
my
way
around
elisp.
so
,
be
gentle.
