my
gut
feel
is
that
document
based
web
service
are
preferred
in
practice
-
is
this
other
people
experience
?
are
they
easier
to
support
?
(
i
noted
that
sharepoint
us
any
for
the
``
document
type
''
in
it
wsdl
interface
,
i
guess
that
make
it
document
based
)
.
also
-
are
people
offering
both
wsdl
and
rest
type
service
now
for
the
same
functionality
?
wsdl
is
popular
for
code
generation
,
but
for
front
end
like
php
and
rails
they
seem
to
prefer
rest
.
