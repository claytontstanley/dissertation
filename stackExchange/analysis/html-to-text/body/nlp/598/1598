i
'm
not
sure
what
the
correct
size
should
be.
many
site
seem
to
repeat
that
the
apple-touch-icon
should
be
57x57
pixel
but
cite
a
broken
link
a
their
source.
hanselman
's
and
playgroundblues
's
comment
suggest
different
size
including
163x163
and
60x60.
apple
's
own
apple.com
icon
is
129x129
!
see
my
related
question
:
how
do
i
give
my
web
site
an
icon
for
iphone
?
