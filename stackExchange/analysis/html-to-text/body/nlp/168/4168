i
'm
looking
for
a
simple
algorithm
to
'serialize
'
a
directed
graph.
in
particular
i
've
got
a
set
of
file
with
interdependency
on
their
execution
order
,
and
i
want
to
find
the
correct
order
at
compile
time.
i
know
it
must
be
a
fairly
common
thing
to
do
-
compiler
do
it
all
the
time
-
but
my
google-fu
ha
been
weak
today.
what
's
the
'go-to
'
algorithm
for
this
?
