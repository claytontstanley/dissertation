i
have
an
absolutely
positioned
div
containing
several
child
,
one
of
which
is
a
relatively
positioned
div.
when
i
use
a
percentage-based
width
on
the
child
div
,
it
collapse
to
0
width
on
ie7
,
but
not
on
firefox
or
safari.
if
i
use
pixel
width
,
it
works.
if
the
parent
is
relatively
positioned
,
the
percentage
width
on
the
child
works.
is
there
something
i
'm
missing
here
?
is
there
an
easy
fix
besides
the
pixel-based
width
on
the
child
?
is
there
an
area
of
the
css
specification
that
cover
this
?
