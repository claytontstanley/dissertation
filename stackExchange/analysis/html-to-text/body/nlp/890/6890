i
have
some
code
for
starting
a
thread
on
the
.net
cf
2.0
:
threadstart
tstart
=
new
threadstart
(
mymethod
)
;
thread
t
=
new
thread
(
tstart
)
;
t.start
(
)
;
if
i
call
this
inside
a
loop
the
item
complete
out
of
order.
how
do
introduce
a
wait
after
t.start
(
)
,
so
that
the
work
on
the
thread
completes
before
the
code
continues
?
will
begininvoke/endinvoke
be
a
better
option
for
this
than
manually
creating
thread
?
