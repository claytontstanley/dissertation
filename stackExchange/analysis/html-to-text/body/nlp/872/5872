if
you
are
working
in
php
(
or
i
guess
any
programming
language
...
)
and
using
subversion
a
your
source
control
,
is
there
a
way
to
take
your
project
(
for
example
)
:
c
:
\projects\test\.svn
c
:
\projects\test\docs\
c
:
\projects\test\faq.php
c
:
\projects\test\guestbook.php
c
:
\projects\test\index.php
c
:
\projects\test\test.php
and
build/copy/whatever
it
so
it
weed
out
certain
file
and
becomes
:
c
:
\projects\test\faq.php
c
:
\projects\test\guestbook.php
c
:
\projects\test\index.php
automagically
?
i
'm
getting
tired
of
making
a
branch
,
and
then
going
through
the
branch
and
deleting
all
of
the
``
.svn
''
folder
,
the
doc
directory
,
and
my
prototyping
file
.
i
know
i
could
probably
use
a
.bat
file
to
only
copy
the
specific
file
i
want
,
but
i
wa
hoping
there
wa
some
way
with
subversion
to
sort
of
pseudo
ignore
a
file
,
to
where
it
will
still
version
it
,
but
where
you
could
make
a
snapshot
of
the
project
that
ignores
the
file
you
told
it
to
psuedo
ignore
.
i
know
i
read
online
somewhere
about
some
functionality
that
at
least
let
you
copy
without
the
.svn
folder
,
but
i
ca
n't
find
it
now
