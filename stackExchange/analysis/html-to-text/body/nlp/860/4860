we
have
a
question
with
regard
to
xml-sig
and
need
detail
about
the
optional
element
a
well
a
some
of
the
canonicalization
and
transform
stuff
.
we
're
writing
a
spec
for
a
very
small
xml-syntax
payload
that
will
go
into
the
metadata
of
medium
file
and
it
need
to
by
cryptographically
signed
.
rather
than
re-invent
the
wheel
,
we
thought
we
should
use
the
xml-sig
spec
but
i
think
most
of
it
is
overkill
for
what
we
need
,
and
so
we
like
to
have
more
information/dialogue
with
people
who
know
the
detail
.
specifically
,
do
we
need
to
care
about
either
transforms
or
canonicalization
if
the
xml
is
very
basic
with
no
tab
for
formatting
and
is
specific
to
our
need
?
thanks
to
all
in
advance
!
