i
currently
have
a
relatively
small
(
4
or
5
table
,
5000
row
)
mysql
database
that
i
would
like
to
convert
to
an
sqlite
database
.
as
i
'd
potentially
have
to
do
this
more
than
once
,
i
'd
be
grateful
if
anyone
could
recommend
any
useful
tool
,
or
at
least
any
easily-replicated
method
.
(
i
have
complete
admin
access
to
the
database/machines
involved
.
)
