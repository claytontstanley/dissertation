i
'm
working
on
an
app
that
convert
source
code
from
using
one
framework
to
another.
i
really
wanted
to
make
the
agonizing
monotonous
job
automatic.
after
looking
a
lot
for
something
that
code
help
me
treat
source
code
in
an
object-oriented
way
and
modify
it
the
closest
thing
i
've
found
wa
jaxmejs
and
that
's
short
of
what
i
need
too.
i
've
been
working
at
creating
my
own
parser
using
antlr
,
but
would
love
not
having
to
do
it
by
myself.
any
recommendation
?
of
course
i
'd
rather
a
java
solution
,
but
i
have
an
open
mind.
thanks
!
