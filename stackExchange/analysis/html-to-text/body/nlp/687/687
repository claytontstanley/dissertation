i
'm
trying
to
improve
my
working
environment
and
i
'm
still
searching
for
that
perfect
keyboard
that
practically
type
bug-free
code
all
by
itself.
at
the
moment
i
'm
using
a
logitech
wave
for
my
windows
need
and
an
apple
wireless
keyboard
(
the
one
without
a
numeric
keypad
)
when
doing
os
x
stuff.
i
'm
quite
happy
with
the
logitech
wave
but
i
would
prefer
one
without
all
the
extra
multimedia
buttons.
what
i
like
most
about
the
apple
wireless
keyboard
is
that
it
is
very
similar
to
the
macbook
's
keyboard
which
for
me
make
it
easier
to
write
code
when
on
my
macbook.
what
kind
of
keyboard
would
you
recommend
for
going
all
out
writing
code
until
your
finger
bleed
?
i
have
remapped
the
caps
lock
key
to
ctrl
which
after
a
while
feel
really
good
,
until
i
have
to
sit
at
another
computer
or
when
someone
at
work
is
going
to
show
me
something
on
my
computer.
are
there
other
little
keyboard
trick
that
you
use
to
get
a
little
bit
more
productive
?
i
have
looked
into
switching
to
dvorak
but
i
have
decided
it
's
not
for
me
.
