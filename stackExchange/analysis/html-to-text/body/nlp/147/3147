i
have
seen
these
being
used
every
which
way
,
and
have
been
accused
of
using
them
the
wrong
way
(
though
in
that
case
,
i
wa
using
them
that
way
to
demonstrate
a
point
)
.
so
,
what
do
you
think
are
the
best
practice
for
employing
extension
methods
?
should
development
team
create
a
library
of
extension
method
and
deploy
them
across
various
project
?
should
there
be
a
collection
of
common
extension
method
in
the
form
of
an
open
source
project
?
update
:
have
decided
to
create
an
organization
wide
extension
method
library
