hello
,
we
are
using
wmv
videos
on
an
internal
site
,
and
we
are
embedding
them
into
web
site
.
now
,
this
work
quite
good
on
internet
explorer
,
but
not
on
firefox
.
i
've
found
way
to
make
it
work
in
firefox
,
but
then
it
stop
working
in
internet
explorer
.
we
do
not
want
to
use
silverlight
just
yet
,
especially
we
can
be
sure
that
all
client
will
be
windows
xp
with
installed
windows
media
player
.
i
just
wonder
:
is
there
some
sort
of
universal
code
that
embeds
wmp
into
both
ie
and
firefox
,
or
do
we
need
to
implement
some
user-agent-detection
and
deliver
different
html
for
different
browsers
?
