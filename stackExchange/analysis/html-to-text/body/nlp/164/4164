i
'm
about
to
start
a
project
for
a
customer
who
want
cms-like
functionality.
they
want
user
to
be
able
to
log
in
,
modify
a
profile
,
and
a
basic
forum.
they
also
wish
to
be
able
to
submit
thing
to
a
front
page.
is
there
a
framework
or
barebones
cms
that
i
could
expand
on
or
tailor
to
my
need
?
i
do
n't
need
anything
a
feature-rich
or
fancy
a
drupal
or
joomla.
i
would
actually
prefer
a
framework
a
opposed
to
a
pre-packaged
cms.
i
am
confident
i
could
code
all
this
from
scratch
,
but
would
prefer
not
to
,
a
something
like
a
framework
would
significantly
cut
down
on
my
time
spent
coding
,
and
more
on
design
and
layout.
edit
:
i
should
have
been
more
specific.
i
'm
looking
for
a
content
management
system
that
will
be
run
on
a
debian
server.
so
no
.net
preferably
.
