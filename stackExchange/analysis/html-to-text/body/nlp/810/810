i
'm
trying
to
maintain
a
setup
project
in
visual
studio
2003
(
yes
,
it
's
a
legacy
application
)
.
the
problem
we
have
at
the
moment
is
that
we
need
to
write
registry
entry
to
hkcu
for
every
user
on
the
computer.
they
need
to
be
in
the
hkcu
rather
than
hklm
because
they
are
the
default
user
setting
,
and
do
change
per
user.
my
feeling
is
that
this
is
n't
possible
this
is
n't
something
the
installer
should
be
doing
,
but
something
the
application
should
be
doing
(
after
all
what
happens
when
a
user
profile
is
created
after
the
install
?
)
.
with
that
in
mind
,
i
still
want
to
change
a
little
a
possible
in
the
application
,
so
my
question
is
,
is
possible
to
add
registry
entry
for
every
user
in
a
visual
studio
2003
setup
project
?
and
,
at
the
moment
the
project
list
five
registry
root
key
(
hkey_classes_root
,
hkey_current_user
,
hkey_local_machine
,
hkey_users
,
and
user/machine
hive
)
,
i
do
n't
really
know
anything
about
the
users
root
key
,
and
have
n't
seen
user/machine
hive.
can
anyone
enlighten
me
on
what
they
are
?
perhapes
they
could
solve
my
problem
above
.
