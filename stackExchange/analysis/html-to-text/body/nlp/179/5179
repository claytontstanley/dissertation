asp.net
server
side
control
postback
to
their
own
page.
this
make
case
where
you
want
to
redirect
a
user
to
an
external
page
,
but
need
to
post
to
that
page
for
some
reason
(
for
authentication
,
for
instance
)
a
pain.
an
httpwebrequest
work
great
if
you
do
n't
want
to
redirect
,
and
javascript
is
fine
in
some
case
,
but
can
get
tricky
if
you
really
do
need
the
server-side
code
to
get
the
data
together
for
the
post.
so
how
do
you
both
post
to
an
external
url
and
redirect
the
user
to
the
result
from
your
asp.net
codebehind
code
?
