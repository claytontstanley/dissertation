i’ve
got
a
lot
of
pdfs/chms
and
they
are
getting
out
of
control
.
so
i’ve
decided
to
do
something
about
it
.
first
i
hit
google
and
didn’t
get
very
far
-
the
range
of
program
are
very
naff
.
then
i
hit
metafilter
and
got
a
lot
more
result
.
from
there
i
learnt
there
is
a
lot
of
program
that
do
exactly
what
i
want
,
look
stylish
and
some
are
even
free
,
but
unfortunately
they
are
all
written
for
the
mac
,
except
one
that
doesn’t
do
what
i
want
(
it
doe
it
all
online
i
want
it
offline
)
.
all
i
want
is
a
program
that
you
can
point
at
a
directory
and
that
will
plow
through
them
and
list
your
document
.
it
can
make
guess
at
content
by
keyword
and
the
list
the
abstract
(
if
it
ha
one
of
course
)
and
allow
me
to
tag
it
.
for
instance
,
doe
the
pdf
book
pragmatic
unit
testing
in
c
#
belong
in
unit
testing
folder
,
the
c
#
folder
or
the
pragmatic
bookshelf
folder
?
it
doesn’t
it
belongs
in
all
three
.
apparently
itunes
doe
what
i
want
it
to
,
but
i
don’t
want
to
install
a
music
program
to
organize
my
pdf’s
-
it
doesn’t
seem
right…
your
suggestion
?
