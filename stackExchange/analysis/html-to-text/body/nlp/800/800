objects
oriented
database
seem
like
a
really
cool
idea
to
me
,
no
need
to
worry
about
mapping
your
domain
model
to
your
database
model
,
no
messing
around
with
sql
or
orm
tools.
the
way
i
understand
it
,
relational
dbs
offer
some
advantage
when
there
is
massive
amount
of
data
,
and
searching
an
indexing
need
to
be
done.
to
my
mind
99
%
of
website
are
not
massive
,
and
enterprise
issue
never
need
to
be
thought
about
,
so
why
ar
n't
oo
dbs
more
widely
used
?
