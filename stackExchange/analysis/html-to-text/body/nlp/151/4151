i
am
in
the
process
of
figuring
out
a
cache
strategy
for
our
current
setup
,
currently
have
multiple
web
server
and
wanted
to
know
what
is
the
best
way
to
cache
data
in
this
environment.
i
have
done
research
about
memcache
and
the
native
asp.net
caching
but
wanted
to
get
some
feedback
first.
should
i
go
with
a
linux
box
if
i
use
memcache
or
a
win32
port
of
memcache.
thanks
!
