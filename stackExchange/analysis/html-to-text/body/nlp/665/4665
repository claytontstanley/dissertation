i
wa
working
with
quality
yesterday
doing
some
formal
testing
.
in
their
procedure
they
were
verifying
all
file
on
the
test
machine
were
pulled
from
the
release
.
the
way
they
were
verifying
these
file
were
the
same
wa
by
checking
the
size
and
the
date/time
stamp
window
put
on
them
in
explorer
.
these
happened
to
be
off
for
another
reason
which
i
wa
able
to
find
out
why
.
is
this
a
valid
way
to
verify
a
file
is
the
same
?
i
did
n't
think
so
and
started
to
argue
,
but
i
am
younger
here
so
thought
i
should
n't
push
it
too
far
.
i
wanted
to
argue
they
should
do
a
binary
compare
on
the
file
to
verify
it
content
are
exact
.
in
my
experience
time/date
stamp
and
size
attribute
do
n't
always
act
a
expected
.
any
thought
?
?
?
