i
am
quite
fond
of
the
intellisense
code
completion
baked
into
microsoft
visual
studio
.
i
find
that
i
only
type
2
to
4
character
of
any
given
keyword
which
drasticaly
speed
up
my
coding
.
now
that
i
have
been
spending
time
writing
some
python
code
i
find
myself
reaching
for
ctrl+space
.
are
there
any
ides
that
support
code
completion
in
python
?
i
do
my
python
development
on
a
mac
so
an
os
x
tool
would
be
preferable
.
it
seems
like
the
doc
string
property
of
python
method
is
a
perfect
match
for
inline
api
discovery
.
