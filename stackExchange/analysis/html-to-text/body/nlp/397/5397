i
would
like
to
implement
an
online
ordering
system
for
restaurant
.
i
am
starting
to
research
this
a
bit
,
and
wanted
to
throw
it
out
here
.
is
there
any
open
source
project
already
started
out
there
i
could
work
with
and
contribute
to
?
would
it
be
easier
to
just
roll
my
own
?
-if
so
,
any
suggestion
on
where
to
start
?
asp.net
,
ruby
on
rails
,
php
?
?
?
payment
processing
?
i
am
pretty
sure
i
would
go
through
google
checkout
.
any
drawback
to
google
checkout
?
edit2-
looking
around
online
i
feel
most
commerce
site
are
geared
towards
product
and
shipping
them
.
the
few
that
are
out
there
seem
like
it
would
be
a
chore
to
implement
and
high
cost
entry
.
i
may
just
have
to
look
at
developing
something
for
now
.
any
ideas/suggestions
on
where
to
start
(
question
#
2
from
above
)
?
?

i
do
n't
think
sms
would
be
a
solution
for
getting
the
order
in
.
the
restaurant
doe
n't
have
a
cellphone
dedicated
for
itself
.
i
wa
looking
towards
making
a
phone
call
when
a
recorded
message
that
there
were
order
queued
,
until
they
were
acknowledged
from
the
restaurant
online
that
they
were
being
processed
.

superjoe30
give
a
link
to
his
online
ordering
system
.
i
took
a
quick
look
,
and
it
look
great
!
i
want
to
clarify
this
is
for
a
cafe
,
therefore
the
ordering
must
reach
the
cafe
in
almost
real
time
.
any
delay
in
getting
the
order
to
the
cook
,
would
slow
thing
up
,
taking
away
the
benefit
of
online
ordering
at
a
cafe
.
any
suggestion
on
getting
the
order
to
the
cafe
immediately
after
the
payment
is
processed
?
i
think
email
would
go
unnoticed
.
i
believe
there
is
a
way
in
.net
to
make
a
phone
call
to
the
cafe
,
that
could
alert
them
of
an
order
and
have
them
print
it
out
.
