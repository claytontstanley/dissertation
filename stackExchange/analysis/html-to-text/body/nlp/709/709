i
'm
looking
to
introduce
a
unit
testing
framework
into
the
mix
at
my
job.
we
're
using
visual
studio
2005
(
though
we
may
be
moving
to
2008
within
the
next
6
month
)
and
work
primarily
in
c
#
.
if
the
framework
ha
some
kind
of
ide
integration
that
would
be
best
,
but
i
'm
open
to
framework
that
do
n't
have
integration
but
are
still
relatively
simple
to
get
set
up.
i
'm
going
to
get
resistance
to
it
one
way
or
another
,
so
if
i
can
make
sure
what
i
'm
pushing
is
n't
a
pain
in
the
neck
,
that
would
help
my
case.
the
obvious
choice
from
the
research
i
've
done
so
far
point
to
nunit
,
but
i
'd
like
to
get
the
impression
of
someone
who
's
actually
used
it
before
recommending
it
to
my
team.
has
anyone
out
there
used
nunit
?
if
so
,
are
there
any
pitfall
or
limitation
of
which
i
should
be
aware
?
are
there
other
good
option
out
there
?
if
so
,
if
you
've
used
both
nunit
at
that
,
i
'd
greatly
appreciate
an
idea
of
the
strength
and
weakness
of
them.
