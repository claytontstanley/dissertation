has
anyone
got
anything
better
than
creating
a
copy
of
the
original
datatable
and
then
looping
through
it
to
create
a
distinct
view
?
from
what
i
've
read
and
attempted
,
the
dataview
doe
n't
support
distinct
(
currently
system
is
in
studio.net
2003
-
looking
to
move
to
2005
shortly
but
2008
is
n't
on
the
radar
-
so
if
newer
version
do
,
please
accept
my
ineptitude
a
a
sign
of
old
age
!
)
.
i
know
i
could
create
another
oracle
procedure
to
create
the
distinct
version
but
i
'm
trying
to
keep
my
call
down
a
certain
part
of
the
system
are
being
pushed
down
the
whole
new
world
of
hurt
that
is
known
a
pda/mobile
route
-
so
it
's
possible
i
may
lose
connection
anyway
and
i
know
i
can
save
stuff
out
to
xml
,
etc
-
but
one
step
at
a
time.
any
thoughts/pointers
gratefully
accepted
.
