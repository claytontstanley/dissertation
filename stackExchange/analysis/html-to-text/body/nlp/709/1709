my
dilemma
is
,
basically
,
how
to
share
an
enumeration
between
two
applications.
the
user
upload
document
through
a
front-end
application
that
is
on
the
web.
this
application
call
a
web
service
of
the
back-end
application
and
pass
the
document
to
it.
the
back-end
app
save
the
document
and
insert
a
row
in
the
document
table.
the
document
type
(
7
possible
document
type
:
invoice
,
contract
etc.
)
is
passed
a
a
parameter
to
the
web
service
's
uploaddocument
method.
the
question
is
,
what
should
the
type
(
and
possible
value
)
of
this
parameter
be
?
since
you
need
to
hardcode
these
value
in
both
application
,
i
think
it
is
o.k.
to
use
a
descriptive
string
(
invoice
,
contract
,
workorder
,
signedworkorder
)
.
is
it
maybe
a
better
approach
to
create
a
documenttypes
enumeration
in
the
first
application
,
and
to
reproduce
it
also
in
the
second
application
,
and
then
pas
the
corresponding
integer
value
to
the
web
service
between
them
?
