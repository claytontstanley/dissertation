one
simple
method
i
've
used
in
the
past
is
basically
just
creating
a
second
table
whose
structure
mirror
the
one
i
want
to
audit
,
and
then
create
an
update/delete
trigger
on
the
main
table.
before
a
record
is
updated/deleted
,
the
current
state
is
saved
to
the
audit
table
via
the
trigger.
while
effective
,
the
data
in
the
audit
table
is
not
the
most
useful
or
simple
to
report
off
of.
i
'm
wondering
if
anyone
ha
a
better
method
for
auditing
data
change
?
