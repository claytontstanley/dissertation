alright
,
so
i
've
always
wanted
to
write
myself
a
nice
little
game
of
life
program
where
you
could
play
with
the
rule
and
adjust
the
number
of
cell
and
such
;
i
've
just
never
really
had
the
time
to
mess
around
to
do
this
(
until
recently
)
.
i
understand
the
basic
algorithm
and
such
(
if
you
do
n't
,
go
to
the
game
of
life
wikipedia
page
to
check
it
out
.
)
but
only
have
a
little
experience
with
gui
programming
.
i
'm
considering
doing
this
in
python
,
but
i
wa
really
wanting
to
figure
out
how
to
go
about
doing
this
in
general
,
so
feel
free
to
give
code
snippet
in
your
language
of
choice
.
to
summarise
:
how
would
you
go
about
programming
a
``
conway
's
game
of
life
''
simulation
in
your
language
of
choice
?
