i
need
to
display
a
map
of
the
u.s.
with
state
shown
in
different
color
according
to
underlying
data.
i
'd
also
like
to
have
this
map
contain
some
facility
for
subscribing
to
hover/click
event
on
each
state
in
javascript
,
presumably
using
an
imagemap.
the
data
wo
n't
be
changing
in
any
kind
of
ajax-y
way
,
so
ideally
this
component
would
generate
a
static
image
that
would
be
cacheable.
any
suggestion
?
