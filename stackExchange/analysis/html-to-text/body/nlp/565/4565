i
'm
talking
about
http
:
//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quality_of_service
.
with
streaming
stackoverflow
podcasts
and
downloading
the
lastest
update
to
ubuntu
,
i
would
like
to
have
qos
working
so
i
can
use
stackoverflow
without
my
http
connection
timing
out
or
taking
forever.
i
'm
using
an
iconnect
624
adsl
modem
which
ha
qos
built-in
but
i
ca
n't
seem
to
get
it
to
work.
is
it
even
possible
to
control
the
downstream
(
ie.
from
isp
to
your
modem
)
?
