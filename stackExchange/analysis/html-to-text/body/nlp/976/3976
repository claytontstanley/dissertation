i
have
a
prolite
led
sign
that
i
like
to
set
up
to
show
scrolling
search
query
from
a
apache
log
and
other
fun
statistic
.
the
problem
is
,
my
g5
doe
not
have
a
serial
port
,
so
i
have
to
use
a
usb
to
serial
dongle
.
it
show
up
a
/dev/cu.usbserial
and
/dev/tty.usbserial
.
when
i
do
this
everything
seems
to
be
hunky-dory
:
stty
-f
/dev/cu.usbserial
speed
9600
baud
;
lflags
:
-icanon
-isig
-iexten
-echo
iflags
:
-icrnl
-ixon
-ixany
-imaxbel
-brkint
oflags
:
-opost
-onlcr
-oxtabs
cflags
:
cs8
-parenb
everything
also
work
when
i
use
the
serial
port
tool
to
talk
to
it
.
if
i
run
this
piece
of
code
while
the
above
mentioned
serial
port
tool
,
everthing
also
work
.
but
a
soon
a
i
disconnect
the
tool
the
connection
get
lost
.
#
!
/usr/bin/python
import
serial
ser
=
serial.serial
(
'/dev/cu.usbserial
'
,
9600
,
timeout=10
)
ser.write
(
``
<
id01
>
<
pa
>
\r\n
''
)
read_chars
=
ser.read
(
20
)
print
read_chars
ser.close
(
)
so
the
question
is
,
what
magicks
do
i
need
to
perform
to
start
talking
to
the
serial
port
without
the
serial
port
tool
?
is
that
a
permission
problem
?
also
,
what
's
the
difference
between
/dev/cu.usbserial
and
/dev/tty.usbserial
?
