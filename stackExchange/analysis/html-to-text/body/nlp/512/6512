i
'm
working
on
a
scheme
interpreter
written
in
c.
currently
it
us
the
c
runtime
stack
a
it
own
stack
,
which
is
presenting
a
minor
problem
with
implementing
continuations.
my
current
solution
is
manual
copying
of
the
c
stack
to
the
heap
then
copying
it
back
when
needed.
aside
from
not
being
standard
c
,
this
solution
is
hardly
ideal.
what
is
the
simplest
way
to
implement
continuation
for
scheme
in
c
?
