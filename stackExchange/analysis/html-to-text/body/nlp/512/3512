i
'm
using
msve
,
and
i
have
my
own
tile
i
'm
displaying
in
layer
on
top
.
problem
is
,
there
's
a
ton
of
them
,
and
they
're
on
a
network
server
.
in
certain
directory
,
there
are
something
on
the
order
of
30,000+
file
.
initially
i
called
directory.getfiles
,
but
once
i
started
testing
in
a
pseudo-real
environment
,
it
timed
out
.
what
's
the
best
way
to
programatically
list
,
and
iterate
through
,
this
many
file
?
edit
:
my
coworker
suggested
using
the
ms
indexing
service
.
has
anyone
tried
this
approach
,
and
(
how
)
ha
it
worked
?
