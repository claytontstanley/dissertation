i
've
been
having
issue
getting
the
c
socket
api
to
work
properly
in
c++
.
specifically
,
although
i
am
including
sys/socket.h
,
i
still
get
compile
time
error
telling
me
that
af_inet
is
not
defined
.
am
i
missing
something
obvious
,
or
could
this
be
related
to
the
fact
that
i
'm
doing
this
coding
on
z/os
and
my
problem
are
much
more
complicated
?
