i
'm
wanting
extra
security
for
a
particular
point
in
my
web
app
.
so
i
want
to
lock
the
database
(
sql
server
2005
)
.
any
suggestion
or
is
this
even
necessary
with
sql
server
?
edit
on
question
:
the
query
is
failing
silently
with
no
error
message
logged
,
and
doe
not
occur
inside
of
a
transaction
.
final
solution
:
i
never
wa
able
to
solve
the
problem
,
however
what
i
wound
up
doing
wa
switching
to
mysql
and
using
a
transactional
level
query
here
.
this
wa
not
the
main
or
even
a
primary
reason
to
switch
.
i
had
been
having
problem
with
sql
server
and
it
allowed
me
to
have
our
cms
and
various
other
tool
all
running
on
the
same
database
.
previous
we
had
a
sql
server
and
a
mysql
database
running
to
run
our
site
.
the
port
wa
a
bit
on
the
time
consuming
however
in
the
long
run
i
feel
it
will
work
much
better
for
the
site
and
the
business
.
