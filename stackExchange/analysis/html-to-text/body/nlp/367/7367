i
'm
looking
for
help
setting
a
new
default
property
value
for
an
inherited
control
in
visual
studio
:
class
newcombo
:
system.windows.forms.combobox
{
public
newcombo
(
)
{
dropdownitems
=
50
;
}
}
the
problem
is
that
the
base
class
property
``
dropdownitems
''
ha
a
'default
'
attribute
set
on
it
that
is
a
different
value
(
not
50
)
.
as
a
result
,
when
i
drag
the
control
onto
a
form
,
the
designer
file
get
an
explicit
'mycontrol.dropdownitems
=
50
;
'
line.
at
first
this
doe
n't
matter.
but
if
later
i
change
my
inherited
class
to
'dropdownitems
=
45
;
'
in
the
constructor
this
doe
not
affect
any
of
the
control
on
any
form
since
all
those
designer
file
still
have
the
value
50
hardcoded
in
them.
and
the
whole
point
wa
to
have
the
value
set
in
one
place
so
i
can
deal
with
the
customer
changing
his
mind.
obviously
,
if
i
were
creating
my
own
custom
property
in
the
subclass
,
i
could
give
it
it
own
designer
default
attribute
of
whatever
i
wanted.
but
here
i
'm
wanting
to
change
the
default
value
of
property
in
the
base.
is
there
any
way
to
apply
visual
studio
attribute
to
a
base
class
member
?
or
is
there
some
other
workaround
to
get
the
result
i
want
?
thanks
for
any
help
