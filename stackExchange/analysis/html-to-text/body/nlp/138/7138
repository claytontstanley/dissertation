i
would
like
to
set
up
vpn
access
for
people
in
my
company
to
use
when
they
are
working
from
home
and
on
the
road.
we
have
a
vpn
service
built
into
our
watchgard
firewall
,
but
it
requires
a
windows-only
custom
client
and
some
of
our
employee
have
macs
or
linux
computers.
i
am
not
any
sort
of
networking
expert
so
the
solution
would
need
to
be
really
easy
to
set
up
,
maintain
,
and
use.
i
have
a
mild
prejudice
toward
linux
solution
but
a
windows
one
would
be
fine
too
so
long
a
it
support
any
kind
of
client
.
