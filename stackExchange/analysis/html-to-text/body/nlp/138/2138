can
a
linq
enabled
app
run
on
a
machine
that
only
ha
the
.net
2.0
runtime
installed
?
in
theory
,
linq
is
nothing
more
than
syntactic
sugar
,
and
the
resulting
il
code
should
look
the
same
a
it
would
have
in
.net
2.0.
how
can
i
write
linq
without
using
the
.net
3.5
library
?
will
it
run
on
.net
2.0
?
