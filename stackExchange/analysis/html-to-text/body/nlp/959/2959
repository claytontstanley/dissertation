scenario
:
you
have
configured
indexing
service
to
index
your
file
,
which
also
include
scanned
image
saved
a
hi-res
tiff
file
.
you
also
have
installed
ms
office
2003+
and
configured
ms
office
document
imaging
(
modi
)
correctly
so
you
can
perform
ocr
on
your
image
and
even
embed
the
ocr
'd
text
into
tiffs
.
awesomeness
:
indexing
service
is
able
to
index
and
find
those
tiffs
that
you
manually
ocr
'd
and
re-saved
with
text
data
(
using
ms
document
imaging
tool
)
.
suck
(
tm
)
:
whatever
you
do
,
you
can
not
make
the
indexing
service
to
ocr
and
index
the
tiff
file
without
text
data
.
you
scour
the
web
,
find
out
how
to
turn
on
modi
debugging
,
and
see
that
cisvc
is
calling
modi
but
somehow
nothing
seems
to
happen
.
hack
:
turns
out
,
data
execution
prevention
(
dep
)
which
is
deployed
with
windows
xp
sp2
think
modi
is
malicious
and
refuse
to
let
it
do
it
magic
.
i
have
been
able
to
remove
the
suck
(
tm
)
by
turning
dep
off
completely
,
but
(
even
though
dep
ha
n't
yet
saved
my
posterior
that
i
can
remember
)
i
found
this
solution
to
be
inelegant
(
read
:
the
customer
's
it
manager
's
gon
na
fry
you
,
if
xe
hears
about
it
)
.
i
'll
share
a
better
solution
here
,
if
i
can
come
across
it
.
