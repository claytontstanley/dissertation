iâ€™ve
had
the
opportunity
to
attend
several
conference
.
some
were
ok
,
but
most
of
time
,
i
feel
like
i
could
have
learned
a
lot
more
from
reading
a
book
or
2
.
the
worst
example
wa
vslive
.
it
cost
my
company
several
thousand
dollar
to
send
me
and
i
feel
like
i
came
away
with
virtually
no
new
information
.
at
a
recent
visual
studio
``
launch
event
''
,
one
of
the
speaker
did
a
quick
poll
and
determined
that
most
people
were
attending
for
the
free
software
(
we
got
a
copy
of
visual
studio
)
or
to
get
a
day
off
work
.
are
it
conference
useful
or
a
waste
of
time
?
