this
is
a
tricky
one
-
and
i
've
always
relied
on
technique
such
a
permission-based
email
(
i.e.
only
sending
to
people
you
have
permission
to
send
to
)
and
not
using
blatantly
spamish
terminology.
of
late
,
some
of
the
email
i
send
out
programmatically
have
started
being
shuffled
into
people
's
spam
folder
automatically
-
and
i
'm
wondering
what
i
can
do
about
it.
this
is
despite
the
fact
that
these
particular
email
are
not
one
that
human
would
mark
a
spam
(
specifically
,
they
are
email
that
contain
license
key
that
people
have
paid
good
money
for
,
so
i
do
n't
think
they
're
going
to
consider
them
spam
)
i
figure
this
is
a
big
topic
in
which
i
am
essentially
an
ignorant
simpleton
.
