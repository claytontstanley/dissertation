often
while
editing
config
file
,
i
'll
open
one
with
vi
and
then
when
i
go
to
save
it
realize
that
i
did
n't
type
sudo
vi
filename
is
there
any
way
to
give
vi
sudo
privilege
to
save
the
file
?
i
seem
to
recall
seeing
something
about
this
while
looking
up
some
stuff
about
vi
a
while
ago
,
but
now
i
ca
n't
find
it
.
