i
use
dnsmasq
to
resolve
dns
query
on
my
home
network
.
unfortunately
,
if
a
domain
name
is
not
known
,
it
will
append
my
own
domain
name
to
the
request
which
mean
that
i
always
end
up
viewing
my
own
site
in
a
browser
.
for
example
,
if
i
enter
http
:
//dlksfhoiahdsfiuhsdf.com
in
a
browser
,
i
end
up
viewing
my
own
site
with
that
url
.
if
i
try
something
like
:
host
dlksfhoiahdsfiuhsdf.com
instead
of
the
expected
:
host
dlksfhoiahdsfiuhsdf.com
not
found
:
3
(
nxdomain
)
i
get
this
:
dlksfhoiahdsfiuhsdf.com.mydomainname.com
ha
address
w.x.y.z
.
clearly
,
dnsmasq
is
appending
my
domain
name
to
impossible
name
request
in
an
effort
to
resolve
them
,
but
i
'd
rather
see
the
not
found
error
instead
.
i
've
tried
playing
with
the
expand-hosts
and
domain
configuration
setting
,
but
to
no
avail
.
is
there
anything
else
i
can
try
?
