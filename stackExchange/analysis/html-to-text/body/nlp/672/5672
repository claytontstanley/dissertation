what
are
folk
out
there
using
for
web/ui
design
?
for
the
most
part
we
use
powerpoint
at
my
company
.
the
ui
folk
will
mock
up
a
screen
in
powerpoint
and
we
(
the
development
group
)
will
take
it
from
there
.
so
,
for
a
side
gig
of
mine
i
decided
to
do
some
mock
ups
to
show
the
client
prior
to
dev
and
i
'm
quickly
feeling
that
powerpoint
is
not
the
right
tool
for
this
.
what
are
you
using
for
this
type
of
stuff
-
some
other
software
?
pen/paper
?
