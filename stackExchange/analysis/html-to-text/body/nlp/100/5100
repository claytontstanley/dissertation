can
anybody
recommend
some
good
portable
apps
for
development
?
i
'd
prefer
not
to
deal
with
u3
,
but
what
i
'm
hoping
for
is
an
ide/editor
with
code
completion
and
syntax
highlighting
.
edit
:
notepad++
appears
to
have
completion
and
some
other
awesome
feature
.
i
think
i
'm
going
to
give
that
a
shot
.
thanks
,
greg
