so
in
my
simple
learning
website
,
i
use
the
built
in
asp.net
authentication
system.
i
am
adding
now
a
user
table
to
save
stuff
like
his
zip
,
dob
etc'.
my
question
is
:
in
the
new
table
,
should
the
key
be
the
user
name
(
the
string
)
or
the
user
id
which
is
that
guid
looking
number
they
use
in
the
asp_
tables.
if
the
best
practice
is
to
use
that
ugly
guid
,
anyone
know
how
to
get
it
?
it
seems
to
not
be
accessible
a
easily
a
the
name
(
system.web.httpcontext.current.user.identity.name
)
if
you
suggest
i
use
neither
(
not
the
guid
nor
the
username
field
provided
by
asp.net
authentication
)
then
how
do
i
do
it
with
asp.net
authentication
?
one
option
i
like
is
to
use
the
email
address
of
the
user
a
login
,
but
how
to
i
make
asp.net
authentication
system
use
an
email
address
instead
of
a
user
name
?
(
or
there
is
nothing
to
do
there
,
it
is
just
me
deciding
i
``
know
''
username
is
actually
an
email
address
?
please
note
:
i
am
not
asking
on
how
to
get
a
guid
in
.net
,
i
am
just
refering
to
the
userid
column
in
the
asp_
table
a
guid.
the
user
name
is
unique
in
asp.net
authentication
