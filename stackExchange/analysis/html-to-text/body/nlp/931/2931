i
have
been
working
with
jxta
2.3
for
the
last
year
or
so
for
a
peer-to-peer
computing
platform
i
am
developing
.
i
am
migrating
to
jxta
2.5
and
in
the
process
i
am
trying
to
clean
up
a
lot
of
my
use
of
jxta
.
for
the
most
part
,
i
approached
jxta
with
a
``
just
make
it
work
''
attitude
.
i
used
it
to
jumpstart
creating
and
managing
my
peer-to-peer
overlay
network
and
providing
basic
communication
service
.
i
would
like
to
use
it
in
a
more
``
jxta
''
way
since
i
am
making
change
to
move
to
2.5
anyway
.
my
first
step
would
be
a
basic
creation
of
a
custom
peergroup
.
i
see
some
new
new
mechanism
that
are
using
the
meta-inf.services
infrastructure
of
java
.
should
i
be
listing
a
related
peergroup
implementing
object
here
with
a
guid
in
net.jxta.platform.module
?
as
i
understand
it
,
if
i
do
this
,
when
a
group
with
a
spec
id
matching
the
guid
is
encountered
and
joined
or
created
it
should
automatically
use
the
matching
object
.
i
should
be
able
to
just
manually
tie
a
peergroup
object
to
the
group
but
this
new
method
using
meta-inf
seems
to
be
a
lot
easier
to
manage
.
does
anyone
have
any
pointer
or
example
of
using
this
infrastructure
for
peergroup
implementation
?
also
,
some
general
information
on
the
meta-inf.services
mechanism
in
java
would
be
helpful
.
