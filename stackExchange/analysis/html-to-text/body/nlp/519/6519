i
am
a
software
engineer
and
i
work
for
a
small
company
,
which
mean
i
have
to
do
just
about
everything
myself.
so
what
is
the
best
way
to
learn
absolutely
everything
you
need
to
know
about
sql
?
everything
from
the
language
,
to
managing
database
,
to
programming
to
a
database
with
c
#
2.0
and
what
what
version
to
use
(
free
for
commercial
use
is
better
,
but
not
required
)
.
