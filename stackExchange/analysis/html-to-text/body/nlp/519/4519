i
have
the
xming
x
window
server
installed
on
a
laptop
running
windows
xp
to
connect
to
some
unix
development
server
.
it
work
fine
when
i
connect
directly
to
the
company
network
in
the
office
.
however
,
it
doe
not
work
when
i
connect
to
the
network
remotely
over
a
vpn
.
when
i
start
xming
when
connected
remotely
none
of
my
terminal
window
are
displayed
.
i
think
it
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
display
environment
variable
not
being
set
correctly
to
the
ip
address
of
the
laptop
when
it
is
connected
.
i
've
noticed
that
when
i
do
an
ipconfig
whilst
connected
remotely
that
my
laptop
ha
two
ip
address
,
the
one
assigned
to
it
from
the
company
network
and
the
local
ip
address
i
've
set
up
for
it
on
my
``
local
network
''
from
my
modem/router
.
are
there
some
configuration
change
i
need
to
make
in
xming
to
support
it
use
through
the
vpn
?
