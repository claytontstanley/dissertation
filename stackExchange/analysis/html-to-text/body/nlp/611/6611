as
most
web
developer
know
,
ie6
is
a
pain
to
support
when
it
come
to
making
a
website
look
and
feel
just
a
in
the
other
major
browser
(
firefox
and
ie7
)
.
i
'd
like
to
know
what
are
the
feeling
of
other
developer
toward
supporting
ie6
on
their
websites.
of
course
if
your
main
user
base
us
ie6
or
if
you
're
working
for
a
client
that
requires
you
to
make
it
work
in
ie6
,
you
do
n't
even
ask
,
but
what
about
a
web
blog
for
example
?
an
interesting
idea
to
help
converting
user
:
