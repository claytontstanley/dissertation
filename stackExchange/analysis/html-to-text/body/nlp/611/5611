i
know
that
just
using
rand
(
)
is
predictable
,
if
you
know
what
your
doing
,
and
have
access
to
the
server
.
i
have
a
project
that
is
highly
dependent
on
choosing
a
random
that
is
a
unpredictable
a
possible
.
so
i
'm
looking
for
suggestion
,
either
other
built
in
function
,
or
user
function
that
can
generate
a
'better
'
random
number
.
i
used
this
to
do
a
little
test
:
$
i=0
;
while
(
$
i
<
10000
)
{
$
rand
=
rand
(
0,100
)
;
if
(
!
isset
(
$
array
[
$
rand
]
)
)
{
$
array
[
$
rand
]
=
1
;
}
else
{
$
array
[
$
rand
]
++
;
}
sort
(
$
array
)
;
$
i++
;
}
i
found
the
result
to
be
evenly
distributed
,
and
there
is
an
odd
pattern
to
the
number
of
time
each
number
is
generated
.
