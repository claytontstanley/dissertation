the
company
i
work
for
is
wanting
to
add
blog
functionality
to
our
website
and
they
were
looking
to
spend
an
awful
amount
of
money
to
have
some
crap
being
built
on
top
of
a
cms
they
purchased
(
sitecore
)
.
i
pointed
them
to
telligent
's
community
server
and
we
had
a
sale
like
meeting
today
to
get
the
marketing
folk
on
board.
my
question
is
if
anyone
ha
had
issue
working
with
community
server
,
skinning
it
and
extending
it
?
i
wanted
to
explain
a
bit
why
i
am
thinking
community
server
,
the
company
is
wanting
multiple
blog
with
multiple
authors.
i
want
to
be
out
of
the
admin
part
of
this
a
much
a
possible
and
did
n't
think
there
were
too
many
engine
that
having
multiple
blog
did
n't
mean
db
work.
i
also
like
the
other
functionality
that
community
server
provides
and
think
the
company
will
find
it
useful
,
particularly
the
medium
section
a
right
now
we
have
some
really
shotty
way
of
dealing
with
whitepapers
and
stuff.
edit
:
we
are
actually
using
the
sitecore
blog
module
for
a
single
blog
on
our
intranet
(
which
is
actually
what
the
cms
is
serving
)
.
some
reasoning
for
why
i
do
n't
like
it
for
our
public
site
are
they
are
on
different
server
,
it
doe
n't
support
multiple
author
,
there
is
no
built
in
syndication
,
it
is
a
little
flimsy
feeling
to
me
from
looking
at
the
source
and
i
personally
think
the
other
feature
of
community
server
make
it
price
tag
worth
it.
another
edit
:
need
to
stick
to
.net
software
that
run
on
sql
server
in
my
company
's
case
,
but
i
do
n't
mind
seeing
recommendation
for
others.
expressionengine
look
promising
,
will
try
it
out
on
my
personal
box
.
