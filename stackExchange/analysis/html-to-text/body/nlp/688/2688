when
you
execute
a
sql
query
,
you
have
to
clean
your
'strings
'
or
user
can
execute
malicious
sql
on
your
website.
i
usually
just
have
a
function
escape_string
(
blah
)
,
which
:
replaces
escape
(
)
with
double
escape
(
\
)
.
replaces
single
quote
(
'
)
with
an
escaped
single
quote
(
\
'
)
.
is
this
adequate
?
is
there
a
hole
in
my
code
?
speedy
library
to
reliably
do
this
for
me
?
i
'd
like
to
see
graceful
solution
in
:
perl
java
php
