i
have
a
bunch
of
latitude/longitude
pair
that
map
to
known
x/y
coordinate
on
a
(
geographically
distorted
)
map.
then
i
have
one
more
latitude/longitude
pair.
i
want
to
plot
it
on
the
map
a
best
is
possible.
how
do
i
go
about
doing
this
?
at
first
i
decided
to
create
a
system
of
linear
equation
for
the
three
nearest
lat/long
point
and
compute
a
transformation
from
these
,
but
this
doe
n't
work
well
at
all.
since
that
's
a
linear
system
,
i
ca
n't
use
more
nearby
point
either.
you
ca
n't
assume
north
is
up
:
all
you
have
is
the
existing
lat/long-
>
x/y
mappings.
edit
:
it
's
not
a
mercator
projection
,
or
anything
like
that.
it
's
arbitrarily
distorted
for
readability
(
think
subway
map
)
.
i
want
to
use
only
the
nearest
5
to
10
mapping
so
that
distortion
on
other
part
of
the
map
doe
n't
affect
the
mapping
i
'm
trying
to
compute.
further
,
the
entire
map
is
in
a
very
small
geographical
area
so
there
's
no
need
to
worry
about
the
globe
--
flat-earth
assumption
are
good
enough
.
