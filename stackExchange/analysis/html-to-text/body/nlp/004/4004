i
am
using
the
.net
httplistener
class
,
but
i
'm
wo
n't
be
running
on
iis
and
am
not
using
asp.net.
this
web
site
describes
what
code
to
actual
use
to
implement
ssl
with
asp.net
and
this
site
describes
how
to
set
up
the
certificate
(
although
i
'm
not
sure
if
it
work
only
for
iis
or
not
)
.
when
i
the
class
documentation
,
it
describes
various
type
of
authentication
(
basic
,
digest
,
windows
,
etc.
)
-
none
of
them
refer
to
ssl.
it
doe
say
that
if
https
is
used
,
you
will
need
to
set
a
server
certificate
.
is
this
going
to
be
a
one
line
property
setting
and
httplistener
figure
out
the
rest
?
in
short
,
i
need
to
know
how
to
set
up
the
certificate
and
how
to
modify
the
code
to
implement
ssl.
although
it
doe
n't
occur
when
i
'm
trying
to
access
https
,
i
did
notice
an
error
in
my
system
event
log
-
the
source
is
``
schannel
''
and
the
content
of
the
message
is
:
a
fatal
error
occurred
when
attempting
to
access
the
ssl
server
credential
private
key.
the
error
code
returned
from
the
cryptographic
module
is
0x80090016.
edit
:
steps
taken
so
far
created
a
working
httplistener
in
c
#
that
work
for
http
connection
(
e.g.
``
http
:
//localhost:8089/foldername/
''
created
a
certificate
using
makecert.exe
added
the
certificate
to
be
trusted
using
certmgr.exe
used
httpcfg.exe
to
listen
for
ssl
connection
on
a
test
port
(
e.g.
8090
)
added
port
8080
to
the
httplistener
via
listener.prefixes.add
(
http
:
//localhost:8090/foldername/
''
)
;
tested
an
http
client
connection
,
e.g.
(
http
:
//localhost:8089/foldername/
''
)
in
a
browser
and
receive
correct
return
tested
an
https
client
connection
,
e.g.
(
http
:
//localhost:8090/foldername/
''
)
in
a
browser
and
receive
``
data
transfer
interrupted
''
(
in
firefox
)
debugging
in
visual
studio
show
that
the
listener
callback
that
receives
the
request
never
get
hit
when
the
https
connection
start
-
i
do
n't
see
any
place
that
i
could
set
a
breakpoint
to
catch
anything
else
earlier.
netstat
show
that
listening
port
are
open
for
both
https
and
http.
the
https
port
doe
go
to
time_wait
after
a
connection
is
attempted.
fiddler
and
httpanalyzer
do
n't
catch
any
of
the
traffic
,
i
guess
it
doe
n't
get
far
enough
in
the
process
to
show
up
in
those
http
analysis
tool
questions
what
could
the
problem
be
?
is
there
a
piece
of
.net
code
i
am
missing
(
meaning
i
have
to
do
more
in
c
#
other
than
simply
add
a
prefix
to
the
listener
that
point
to
https
,
which
is
what
i
have
done
)
have
a
missed
a
configuration
step
somewhere
?
what
else
might
i
do
to
analyze
the
problem
?
is
the
error
message
in
the
system
event
log
a
sign
of
the
problem
?
if
so
how
would
it
be
fixed
?
