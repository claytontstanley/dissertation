i
have
an
element
which
may
contain
very
big
amount
of
data
,
but
i
do
n't
want
it
to
ruin
the
page
layout
,
so
i
set
max-height
:
100px
and
overflow
:
auto
,
hoping
for
scrollbars
to
appear
when
the
content
doe
not
fit.
it
all
work
fine
in
firefox
and
ie7
,
but
ie8
behaves
a
if
overflow
:
hidden
wa
present
instead
of
overflow
:
auto.
i
tried
overflow
:
scroll
,
still
doe
not
help
,
ie8
simply
truncates
the
content
without
showing
scrollbars.
changing
max-height
declaration
to
height
make
overflow
work
ok
,
it
's
the
combination
of
max-height
and
overflow
:
auto
that
break
things.
this
is
also
logged
a
an
official
bug
in
the
final
,
release
version
of
ie8
:
http
:
//connect.microsoft.com/ie/feedback/viewfeedback.aspx
?
feedbackid=408759
does
anyone
know
of
a
workaround
?
for
now
i
resorted
to
using
height
instead
of
max-height
,
but
it
leaf
plenty
of
empty
space
in
case
there
is
n't
much
data.
before
you
tell
me
to
do
that
,
yes
,
i
've
reported
the
bug
to
ie
developer
