i
'm
working
on
a
project
which
us
.net
remoting
for
communication
between
the
client
application
and
an
object
server.
for
development
,
the
client
,
server
,
and
mssql
database
are
all
running
on
my
local
development
machine.
when
i
'm
working
at
the
office
,
the
responsiveness
is
just
fine.
however
,
when
i
work
from
home
the
speed
is
significantly
slower.
if
i
disconnect
from
the
vpn
,
it
speed
up
(
i
believe
,
but
maybe
that
's
just
wishful
thinking
)
.
if
i
turn
off
my
wireless
connection
completely
it
immediately
speed
up
to
full
throttle.
my
assumption
is
that
the
remoting
traffic
is
being
routed
through
some
point
that
is
slowing
everything
down
,
albeit
my
home
router
and/or
the
vpn.
does
anyone
have
any
idea
of
how
to
force
the
remoting
traffic
to
remain
completely
localized
?
