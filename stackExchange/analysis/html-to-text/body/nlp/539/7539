hi
,
recently
i
tried
understanding
the
use
of
java.math.mathcontext
but
failed
to
understand
properly
.
is
it
used
for
rounding
in
java.math.bigdecimal
,
if
yes
why
doe
not
it
round
the
decimal
digit
but
even
mentissa
part
.
from
api
doc
,
i
came
to
know
that
it
follows
the
standard
specified
in
ansi
x3.274-1996
and
ansi
x3.274-1996/am
1-2000
specification
but
i
did
not
get
them
to
read
online
.
please
let
me
know
if
you
have
any
idea
on
this
.
thanks
in
advance
.
