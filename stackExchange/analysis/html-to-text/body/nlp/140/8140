is
there
a
general
procedure
for
programming
extensibility
capability
into
your
code
?
i
am
wondering
what
the
general
procedure
is
for
adding
extension-type
capability
to
a
system
you
are
writing
so
that
functionality
can
be
extended
through
some
kind
of
plugin
api
rather
than
having
to
modify
the
core
code
of
a
system
.
do
such
thing
tend
to
be
dependent
on
the
language
the
system
wa
written
in
,
or
is
there
a
general
method
for
allowing
for
this
?
