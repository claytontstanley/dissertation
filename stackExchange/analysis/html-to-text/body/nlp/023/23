i
'm
trying
to
track
the
progress
of
php
5.3
and
php
6
and
i
occassionally
see
blog
posting
information
but
there
doe
n't
seem
to
be
an
authoritative
source.
does
anybody
know
where
there
is
an
official
summary
of
possible
new
feature
?
edit
:
there
are
some
meeting
note
that
have
been
around
for
year
...
a
far
a
i
can
tell
this
meeting
ha
long
since
been
superceded
and
nearly
all
of
the
other
information
out
there
is
based
entirely
on
that
meeting.
i
'm
more
looking
for
where
the
php
developer
themselves
record
the
change
that
they
are
currently
making
rather
than
the
long-term
vision
.
