i
've
seen
a
number
of
place
recently
that
offer
online
html
api
documentation
and
also
offer
downloadable
(
usually
.chm
)
help
file
.
i
really
love
using
.chm
help
file
,
mainly
because
of
the
index
tree
on
the
left
.
what
are
the
best
tool
for
creating
those
type
of
file
?
is
there
something
that
would
allow
me
to
have
a
bunch
of
html
file
that
can
be
put
online
and
also
compiled
into
a
.chm
?
edit
(
expanding
the
scope
of
my
original
question
)
all
of
the
tool
below
look
interesting
,
especially
sandcastle
which
i
'm
downloading
now
.
are
there
any
command-line
tool
for
linux
that
do
this
?
