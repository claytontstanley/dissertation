i
have
a
terrible
habit
of
half-cooking
up
an
idea
for
a
project
and
then
once
i
feel
that
i
've
solved
the
interesting
bit
it
get
boring
and
i
move
on.
of
course
,
experience
with
the
project
that
i
do
end
up
following
through
on
say
that
i
have
n't
solved
it
at
all.
what
technique
do
you
employ
to
try
and
deal
with
this
sort
of
behavior
?
