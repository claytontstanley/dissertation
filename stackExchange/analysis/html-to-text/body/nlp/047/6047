at
work
we
have
a
2
x
4
24
inch
monitor
video
wall
served
by
a
single
mac
pro
with
a
bunch
of
video
card
.
it
's
an
architectural
feature
of
the
office
and
not
a
particularly
good
way
to
use
those
nice
24
inch
dell
.
we
mostly
put
a
few
of
our
website
on
some
screen
and
run
gltail
on
some
for
watching
traffic
.
sometimes
we
tail
-f
error
log
.
my
question
is
this
:
what
other
pretty
log
analyzer
except
gltail
are
there
?
all
those
bouncing
ball
in
gltail
seem
to
slow
down
the
rendering
significantly
,
and
it
seems
impossible
to
turn
it
off
.
what
other
thing
we
can
stick
on
there
?
you
'd
be
surprised
a
to
how
useful
this
thing
is
-
yesterday
we
noticed
that
one
of
the
three
virtual
server
wa
a
lot
slower
than
usual
.
it
wa
still
up
and
serving
and
because
of
that
did
not
trip
our
monitoring
,
but
wa
slow
enough
to
warrant
a
restart
.
