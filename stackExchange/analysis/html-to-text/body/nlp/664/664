i
'd
like
to
contribute
to
open
source
but
i
'm
not
a
professional
programmer.
i
contributed
an
extra
function
to
a
php
project
once
,
but
on
submission
it
wa
rewritten
and
,
in
hindsight
,
the
functionality
wa
completely
useless
anyway.
i
wa
actively
encouraged
by
the
project
member
who
were
very
supportive
but
i
ca
n't
help
feeling
i
wa
generating
more
work
than
wa
necessary
for
them.
i
suppose
the
question
is
-
are
novice
programmer
a
hindrance
to
a
project
?
