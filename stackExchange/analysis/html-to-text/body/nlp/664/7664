i
am
wrapping
existing
c++
code
from
a
bsd
project
in
our
own
custom
wrapper
and
i
want
to
integrate
it
to
our
code
with
a
few
change
a
possible
.
this
code
us
fprintf
to
print
to
stderr
in
order
to
log
/
report
error
.
i
want
to
redirect
this
to
an
alternative
place
within
the
same
process
.
on
unix
i
have
done
this
with
a
socketpair
and
a
thread
:
one
end
of
the
socket
is
where
i
send
stderr
(
via
a
call
to
dup2
)
and
the
other
end
is
monitored
in
a
thread
,
where
i
can
then
process
the
output
.
this
doe
not
work
on
window
though
because
a
socket
is
not
the
same
a
a
file
handle
.
all
document
i
have
found
on
the
web
show
how
to
redirect
output
from
a
child
process
,
which
is
not
what
i
want
.
how
can
i
redirect
stderr
within
the
same
process
getting
a
callback
of
some
sort
when
output
is
written
?
(
and
before
you
say
so
,
i
've
tried
setstdhandle
but
can
not
find
any
way
to
make
this
work
)
...
thanks
!
