i
'm
looking
for
a
way
to
delete
a
file
which
is
locked
by
another
process
using
c
#
.
i
suspect
the
method
must
be
able
to
find
which
process
is
locking
the
file
(
perhaps
by
tracking
the
handle
,
although
i
'm
not
sure
how
to
do
this
in
c
#
)
then
close
that
process
before
being
able
to
complete
the
file
delete
using
file.delete
(
)
.
