i
have
read
a
lot
that
lisp
can
redefine
syntax
on
the
fly
,
presumably
with
macros.
i
am
curious
how
far
doe
this
actually
go
?
can
you
redefine
the
language
structure
so
much
that
it
borderline
becomes
a
compiler
for
another
language
?
for
example
,
could
you
change
the
functional
nature
of
lisp
into
a
more
object
oriented
syntax
and
semantics
,
maybe
say
having
syntax
closer
to
something
like
ruby
?
especially
,
is
it
possible
to
get
rid
of
the
parenthesis
hell
using
macro
?
i
have
learned
enough
(
emacs-
)
lisp
to
customize
emacs
with
my
own
micro-features
,
but
i
am
very
curious
how
far
macro
can
go
in
customizing
the
language
.
