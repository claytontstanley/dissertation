i
am
trying
to
enable
full-text
indexing
in
sql
server
2005
express
.
i
am
running
this
on
my
laptop
with
vista
ultimate
.
i
understand
that
the
standard
version
of
sql
server
express
doe
not
have
full-text
indexing
.
i
have
already
downloaded
and
installed
``
microsoft
sql
server
2005
express
edition
with
advanced
services
service
pack
2
''
(
download
)
.
i
have
also
ensured
that
both
the
``
sql
server
(
instance
)
''
and
``
sql
server
fulltext
search
(
instance
)
''
service
are
running
on
the
same
account
which
is
``
network
service
''
.
i
have
also
selected
the
option
to
``
use
full-text
indexing
''
in
the
database
properties
>
files
area
.
i
can
run
the
sql
query
``
select
fulltextserviceproperty
(
'isfulltextinstalled
'
)
;
''
and
return
1
.
the
problem
i
am
having
is
that
when
i
have
my
table
open
in
design
view
and
select
``
manage
fulltext
index
''
;
the
full-text
index
window
display
the
message
...
''
creation
of
the
full-text
index
is
not
available
.
check
that
you
have
the
correct
permission
or
that
full-text
catalog
are
defined
.
``
any
idea
on
what
to
check
or
where
to
go
next
?
