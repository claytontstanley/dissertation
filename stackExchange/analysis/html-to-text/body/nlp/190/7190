what
tool
would
you
recommend
for
setting
up
ci
for
build
and
deployment
of
multiple
website
built
on
dotnetnuke
using
svn
for
source
control
?
we
are
currently
looking
at
configuring
cruise
control
to
work
with
nant
,
nunit
,
ncover
and
trac
a
a
test
case
.
what
other
combination
would
worth
investigating
?
we
have
full
control
of
our
development
environment
so
using
some
form
of
ci
is
certain
here
but
i
would
also
like
to
convince
our
production
service
team
that
they
can
reliably
deploy
to
the
system
test
,
uat
and
even
production
environment
using
these
tool
.
