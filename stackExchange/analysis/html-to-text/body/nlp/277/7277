i
'm
generating
some
xml
document
and
when
it
come
to
the
address
part
i
have
fragment
that
look
like
this
:
<
address
>
15
sample
st
example
bay
some
country
<
/address
>
the
xslt
that
i
have
for
converting
this
to
xhtml
ha
some
funky
recursive
template
to
convert
newline
character
within
string
to
<
br/
>
tag
.
this
is
all
working
fine
;
but
is
it
considered
``
bad
practice
''
to
rely
on
linebreaks
within
xml
document
?
if
so
,
is
it
recommended
that
i
do
this
instead
?
<

<

<

<
/address

seems
like
it
'd
be
really
awkward
to
wrap
every
place
where
my
text
may
be
multiple
line
with
tag
like
that..
