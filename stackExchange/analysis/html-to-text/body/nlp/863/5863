i
'm
just
getting
into
creating
some
wcf
service
,
but
i
have
a
requirement
to
make
them
backward
compatible
for
legacy
(
.net
1.1
and
2.0
)
client
application
.
i
've
managed
to
get
the
service
to
run
correctly
for
3.0
and
greater
client
,
but
when
i
publish
the
service
using
a
basichttpbinding
endpoint
(
which
i
believe
is
required
for
the
compatibility
i
need
)
,
the
service
refactors
my
method
signature
.
e.g
.
public
bool
methodtoreturntrue
(
string
seedvalue
)
;
appears
to
the
client
apps
a
public
void
methodtoreturntrue
(
string
seedvalue
,
out
bool
result
,
out
bool
methodtoreturntrueresultspecified
)
;
i
've
tried
every
configuration
parameter
i
can
think
of
in
the
app.config
for
my
self-hosting
console
app
,
but
i
ca
n't
seem
to
make
this
function
a
expected
.
i
suppose
this
might
lead
to
the
fact
that
my
expectation
are
flawed
,
but
i
'd
be
surprised
that
a
wcf
service
is
incapable
of
handling
a
bool
return
type
to
a
down-level
client
.
my
current
app.config
look
like
this
.
