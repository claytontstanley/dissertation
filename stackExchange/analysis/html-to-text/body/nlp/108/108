i
've
been
using
tortoisesvn
in
a
windows
environment
for
quite
some
time.
it
seems
very
feature-complete
and
nicely
integrated
into
the
windows
shell
,
and
more
importantly
,
it
's
fairly
painless
to
teach
to
colleague
with
little
or
no
experience
with
source
control.
however
,
since
we
have
moved
to
windows
vista
64bit
,
tortoise
ha
been
very
buggy
and
ha
seemed
to
cause
lot
of
explorer.exe
abnormality
and
crashes.
this
ha
happened
both
with
older
version
of
the
software
and
the
latest
version
(
1.5.1
build
13563
)
.
i
wa
curious
if
anyone
ha
suggestion
for
other
subversion
client
that
will
run
on
windows
(
specifically
vista
64bit
)
.
developers
here
use
a
variety
of
text
editor
so
using
visual
studio
or
dreamweaver
for
svn
is
not
ideal.
i
have
heard
great
thing
about
cornerstone
,
and
would
love
something
similar
for
windows
if
it
exists
.
