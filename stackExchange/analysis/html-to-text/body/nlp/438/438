my
rails-app
ha
a
sign
in
box
with
a
``
remember
me
''
checkbox.
users
who
check
that
box
should
remain
logged
in
even
after
closing
their
browser.
i
'm
keeping
track
of
whether
user
are
logged
in
by
storing
their
id
in
the
user
's
session.
but
session
are
implemented
in
rails
a
session
cooky
,
which
are
not
persistent.
i
can
make
them
persistent
:
class
applicationcontroller
<
actioncontroller
:
:base
before_filter
:
update_session_expiration_date
private
def
update_session_expiration_date
option
=
actioncontroller
:
:base.session_options
unless
option
[
:
session_expires
]
option
[
:
session_expires
]
=
1.year.from_now
end
end
end
but
that
seems
like
a
hack
,
which
is
surprising
for
such
common
functionality.
is
there
a
better
way
?
edit
gareth
's
answer
is
pretty
good
,
but
i
would
still
like
an
answer
from
someone
familiar
with
rails
2
(
because
of
it
unique
cookiesessionstore
)
.
