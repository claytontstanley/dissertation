i
'm
writing
a
resource
handling
method
where
i
control
access
to
various
file
,
and
i
'd
like
to
be
able
to
make
use
of
the
browser
's
cache.
my
question
is
two-fold
:
which
are
the
definitive
http
header
that
i
need
to
check
in
order
to
know
for
sure
whether
i
should
send
a
304
response
,
and
what
am
i
looking
for
when
i
do
check
them
?
additionally
,
are
there
any
header
that
i
need
to
send
when
i
initially
send
the
file
(
like
'last-modified
'
)
a
a
200
response
?
some
psuedo-code
would
probably
be
the
most
useful
answer.
thanks
.
