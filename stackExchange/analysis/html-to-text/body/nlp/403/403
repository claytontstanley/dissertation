for
our
small
team
of
20
developer
,
we
used
do
code
review
like
:
make
a
label
in
svn
and
publish
the
label
to
the
reviewer
reviewers
checkout
the
code
and
add
comment
in
line
(
with
marker
like
:
//
reviewer_name
:
:review
comment
:
)
after
all
comment
are
in
,
reviewer
check
in
the
code
,
preferably
with
new
label.
developer
check
the
comment
and
make
change
(
if
appropriate
)
developer
keep
an
excel
sheet
report
for
considered
change
and
reason
for
ignored
comment
problem
:
developer
need
to
keep
track
of
multiple
label
which
might
have
same
comment
sometimes
we
even
do
one
on
one
review
and
if
we
really
have
time
,
even
do
table
review
(
team
of
reviewer
look
at
the
code
on
projector
,
on
the
fly
,
and
pas
comment
)
i
wa
wondering
:
are
you
guy
using
any
specific
tool
which
help
to
do
code
review
smoother
?
i
have
heard
of
code
collaborator
.
but
have
anyone
used
that
?
is
it
worth
the
money
?
