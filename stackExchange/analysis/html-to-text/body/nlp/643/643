when
i
used
metacity
,
i
could
drag
window
between
workspace
using
the
small
icon
view
of
my
workspace
.
i
recently
started
using
compiz
for
all
the
cool
desktop
effect
,
however
this
drag
and
drop
feature
is
n't
working
.
i
use
the
cube
effect
for
switching
workspace
,
but
i
noticed
the
wall
effect
doe
n't
allow
it
either
.
is
this
just
a
missing
feature
from
compiz
or
is
there
a
setting
somewhere
that
i
can
enable
it
?
i
know
that
i
can
enable
dragging
window
across
edge
to
the
next
workspace
,
and
the
expose
feature
to
drag
window
between
workspace
.
however
,
the
drag
and
drop
on
the
icon
view
is
really
powerful
,
and
i
would
love
to
have
it
back
along
with
all
the
great
compiz
special
effect
.
