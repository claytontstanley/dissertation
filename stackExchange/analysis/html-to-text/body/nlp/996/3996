i
have
windows
file
sharing
enabled
on
an
os
x
10.4
computer
.
it
's
accessible
via
\rudy\myshare
for
all
the
windows
user
on
the
network
,
except
for
one
guy
running
vista
ultimate
64-bit
edition
.
all
the
other
user
are
running
vista
or
xp
,
all
32-bit
.
all
the
workgroup
information
is
the
same
,
all
login
with
the
same
username/password
.
the
vista
64
guy
can
see
the
mac
on
the
network
,
but
his
login
is
rejected
every
time
.
now
,
i
imagine
that
vista
ultimate
is
ha
something
configured
differently
to
the
business
version
and
xp
but
i
do
n't
really
know
where
to
look
.
any
idea
?
