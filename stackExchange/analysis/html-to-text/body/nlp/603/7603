can
anyone
point
me
to
some
decent
introduction
to
ws-security
?
i
'm
looking
for
tutorial
or
something
that
provide
a
fairly
gentle
introduction
to
the
subject
,
though
i
do
n't
mind
if
it
assumes
basic
knowledge
of
web
service
and
soap
.
most
of
the
stuff
i
've
seen
so
far
is
very
technical
and
you
need
a
lot
of
complex
,
detailed
background
knowledge
to
understand
it
properly
.
we
have
to
implement
a
web
service
in
php
and
one
or
more
client
in
.net
,
so
resource
covering
both
would
be
much
appreciated
.
