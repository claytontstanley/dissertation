first
of
all
,
congrats
to
jeff
,
joel
and
the
guy
for
getting
this
thing
up
and
running
!
ok
,
i
've
been
developing
a
site
using
asp.net
mvc
,
and
have
decided
to
use
the
new
sql
server
2008
filestream
facility
to
store
file
'within
'
the
database
rather
than
a
separate
entities.
while
initially
working
within
vs2008
(
using
a
trusted
connection
to
the
database
)
,
everything
wa
fine
and
dandy.
issues
arose
,
however
,
when
i
shifted
the
site
to
iis7
and
changed
over
to
sql
authentication
on
the
database.
it
seems
that
streaming
a
filestream
doe
n't
work
with
sql
authentication
,
only
with
windows
authentication.
given
this
,
what
is
the
best
practice
to
follow
?
is
there
a
way
to
force
this
wort
of
thing
to
work
under
sql
authentication
?
should
i
add
network
service
a
a
database
user
and
then
use
trusted
authentication
?
should
i
create
another
user
,
and
run
both
the
iis
site
and
the
database
connection
under
this
?
any
other
suggestion
?
thanks
in
advance
.
