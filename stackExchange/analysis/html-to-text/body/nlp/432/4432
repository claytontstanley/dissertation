typical
way
of
creating
a
csv
string
(
pseudocode
)
:
create
a
csv
container
object
(
like
a
stringbuilder
in
c
#
)
loop
through
the
string
you
want
to
add
appending
a
comma
after
each
one
after
the
loop
,
remove
that
last
superfluous
comma
.
code
sample
:
public
string
returnascsv
(
contactlist
contactlist
)
{
stringbuilder
sb
=
new
stringbuilder
(
)
;
foreach
(
contact
c
in
contactlist
)
{
sb.append
(
c.name
+
``
,
''
)
;
}
sb.remove
(
sb.length
-
1
,
1
)
;
//sb.replace
(
``
,
''
,
``
''
,
sb.length
-
1
,
1
)
return
sb.tostring
(
)
;
}
i
feel
that
there
should
be
an
easier
/
cleaner
/
more
efficient
way
of
removing
that
last
comma
.
any
idea
?
update
i
like
the
idea
of
adding
the
comma
by
checking
if
the
container
is
empty
,
but
doe
n't
that
mean
more
processing
a
it
need
to
check
the
length
of
the
string
on
each
occurrence
?
