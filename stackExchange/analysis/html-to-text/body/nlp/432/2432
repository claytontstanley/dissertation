ever
seen
any
of
there

message

)

@
(
everyone
wanting
me
to
post
the
query
)
:
i
'm
not
sure
if
i
can
paste
70
kilobyte
of
code
in
the
answer
editing
window
.
even
if
i
can
this
this
wo
n't
help
since
this
70
kilobyte
of
code
will
reference
20
or
30
view
that
i
would
also
have
to
post
since
otherwise
the
code
will
be
meaningless
.
i
do
n't
want
to
sound
like
i
am
boasting
here
but
the
problem
is
not
in
the
query
.
the
query
are
optimal
(
or
at
least
almost
optimal
)
.
i
have
spent
countless
hour
optimizing
them
,
looking
for
every
single
column
and
every
single
table
that
can
be
removed
.
imagine
a
report
that
ha
200
or
300
column
that
ha
to
be
filled
with
a
single
select
statement
(
because
that
's
how
it
wa
designed
a
few
year
ago
when
it
wa
still
a
small
report
)
.
