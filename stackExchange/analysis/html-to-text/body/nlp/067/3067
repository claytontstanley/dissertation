if
you
've
ever
used
eclipse
,
you
've
probably
noticed
the
great
keyboard
shortcut
that
let
you
hit
a
shortcut
key
combination
,
then
just
type
the
first
few
character
of
a
function
,
class
,
filename
,
etc.
it
's
even
smart
enough
to
put
open
file
first
in
the
list.
i
'm
looking
for
a
similar
functionality
for
visual
studio
2008.
i
know
there
's
a
findfiles
plugin
on
codeproject
,
but
that
one
is
buggy
and
a
little
weird
,
and
doe
n't
give
me
access
to
function
or
class
.
