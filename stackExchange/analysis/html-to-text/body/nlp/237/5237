at
work
,
we
are
often
working
on
multiple
branch
of
our
product
at
one
time.
for
example
,
right
now
,
we
have
a
maintenance
branch
,
a
branch
with
code
just
going
to
qa
,
and
a
branch
for
a
new
major
initiative
,
that
wo
n't
be
merged
for
some
time
now.
our
web
project
is
set
up
to
use
iis
,
so
every
time
we
switch
to
a
different
branch
,
we
have
to
go
in
to
iis
admin
and
change
the
path
on
the
virtual
directory
,
then
reset
iis
,
and
sometimes
even
restart
visual
studio
,
to
avoid
getting
build
errors.
is
there
any
way
to
simplify
this
,
other
than
not
having
our
web
project
set
up
a
a
virtual
directory
?
i
'm
not
sure
we
want
to
make
that
change
at
this
point.
what
do
you
do
to
make
this
easier
,
assuming
you
do
this
?
corey
@
redwolves
,
virtual
machine
would
definitely
work
,
but
i
'm
not
sure
it
would
be
any
simpler
,
especially
for
some
of
the
other
developer
on
my
team
,
which
is
partly
why
i
'm
looking
for
more
simplicity.
@
dan
,
we
're
not
able
to
change
source
control
provider
,
unfortunately.
@
pix0r
,
that
's
something
i
'll
try
when
i
get
back
to
work.
thanks
for
the
suggestion.
@
haacked
,
i
'll
have
to
give
that
a
try
too
,
but
i
think
we
have
some
issue
with
why
that
wo
n't
work
(
i
ca
n't
remember
exactly
why
right
now
;
this
application
wa
originally
written
in
.net
1.1
,
pre-cassini
,
and
i
ca
n't
remember
if
we
tried
it
when
we
upgraded
to
2.0
or
not
)
.
thanks
all
for
the
response
so
far
.
