our
software
must
be
able
to
run
on
sql
server
2000
and
2005
.
to
simplify
development
,
we
're
running
our
sql
server
2005
database
in
compatibility
level
80
.
however
,
database
performance
seems
slower
on
sql
2005
than
on
sql
2000
in
some
case
(
we
have
not
confirmed
this
using
benchmark
yet
)
.
would
upgrading
the
compatibility
level
to
90
improve
performance
on
the
sql
2005
server
?
