i
have
a
control
that
is
modelled
on
a
combobox
.
i
want
to
render
the
control
so
that
the
control
border
look
like
that
of
a
standard
windows
combobox
.
specifically
,
i
have
followed
the
msdn
documentation
and
all
the
rendering
of
the
control
is
correct
except
for
rendering
when
the
control
is
disabled
.
just
to
be
clear
,
this
is
for
a
system
with
visual
styles
enabled
.
also
,
all
part
of
the
control
render
properly
except
the
border
around
a
disabled
control
,
which
doe
not
match
the
disabled
combobox
border
colour
.
i
am
using
the
visualstylerenderer
class
.
msdn
suggests
using
the
visualstyleelement.textbox
element
for
the
textbox
part
of
the
combobox
control
but
a
standard
disabled
textbox
and
a
standard
disabled
combobox
draw
slightly
differently
(
one
ha
a
light
grey
border
,
the
other
a
light
blue
border
)
.
how
can
i
get
correct
rendering
of
the
control
in
a
disabled
state
?
