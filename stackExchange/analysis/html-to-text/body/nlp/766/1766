i
'm
looking
for
a
good
editor
for
both
html
and
css.
i
currently
use
the
firebug
firefox
extension
,
and
this
is
a
great
tool
,
but
i
'm
looking
for
something
i
can
use
without
necessarily
firing
up
a
browser.
ideally
it
would
have
a
live
preview
of
what
i
'm
coding.
edit
:
as
a
student
,
i
have
access
to
msdn.
also
,
i
have
access
to
windows
,
mac
,
and
linux.
so
any
platform
will
do
.
