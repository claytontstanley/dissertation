i
can
get
python
to
work
with
postgresql
but
i
can
not
get
it
to
work
with
mysql
.
the
main
problem
is
that
on
the
shared
hosting
account
i
have
i
do
not
have
the
ability
to
install
thing
such
a
django
or
pysql
,
i
generally
fail
when
installing
them
on
my
computer
so
maybe
it
's
good
i
ca
n't
install
on
the
host
.
i
found
bpgsql
really
good
because
it
doe
not
require
an
install
,
it
's
a
single
file
that
i
can
look
at
,
read
and
then
call
the
function
of
.
does
anybody
know
of
something
like
this
for
mysql
?
