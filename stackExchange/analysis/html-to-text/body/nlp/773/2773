i
've
followed
this
otherwise
excellent
tutorial
on
getting
xen
working
with
ubuntu
but
am
not
able
to
get
a
console
into
my
virtual
machine
(
domu
)
.
i
've
got
the
extra
=
'2
console=xvc0
'
line
in
my
/etc/xen/hostname_here.cfg
file
like
they
say
,
but
am
not
able
to
get
a
console
on
it
.
if
i
statically
assign
an
ip
to
the
vm
i
can
ssh
to
it
,
but
for
now
i
need
to
be
able
to
use
dhcp
to
give
it
an
address
(
and
since
that
's
what
i
'm
trying
to
debug
,
there
's
the
problem
)
.
i
know
i
've
got
a
free
dhcp
address
(
although
i
'm
getting
more
at
the
moment
)
,
so
i
do
n't
think
that
's
the
problem
.
i
've
looked
on
google
and
the
xen
forum
to
no
avail
a
well
.
any
idea
?
