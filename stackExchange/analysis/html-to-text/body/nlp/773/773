i
have
n't
been
able
to
find
an
understandable
explanation
of
how
to
actually
use
python
's
itertools.groupby
(
)
function.
what
i
'm
trying
to
do
is
this
:
take
a
list
-
in
this
case
,
the
child
of
an
objectified
lxml
element
-
divide
it
into
group
based
on
some
criterion
,
and
then
later
iterate
over
each
of
these
group
separately.
i
've
reviewed
the
documentation
(
http
:
//docs.python.org/lib/itertools-functions.html
)
,
and
the
example
,
(
http
:
//docs.python.org/lib/itertools-example.html
)
,
but
i
've
had
trouble
trying
to
apply
them
beyond
a
simple
list
of
numbers.
so
,
how
do
i
use
of
itertools.groupby
(
)
?
is
there
another
technique
i
should
be
using
?
pointers
to
good
``
prerequisite
''
reading
would
also
be
appreciated
.
