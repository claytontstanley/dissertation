i
'm
going
to
start
a
new
project
-
rewriting
an
existing
system
(
php
+
sql
server
)
from
scratch
because
of
some
very
serious
limitation
by
design
.
we
have
some
quite
good
knowledge
of
sql
server
(
currently
we
're
using
sql
server
2000
in
existing
system
)
and
we
would
like
to
employ
it
newer
version
(
2008
i
guess
)
in
our
new
project
.
i
am
really
fond
of
technology
that
java
offer
-
particularly
spring
framework
and
wicket
and
i
am
quite
familiar
with
java
from
others
project
and
assignment
before
.
therefore
,
we
consider
using
java
and
microsoft
sql
server
.
there
are
two
jdbc
driver
for
sql
server
-
jtds
and
microsoft
's
one
-

.
i
think
we
should
test
both
of
them
.
are
there
any
limitation
in
such
solution
i
should
know
of
?
has
someone
experience
with
such
a
technology
combination
?
