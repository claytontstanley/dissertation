i
am
trying
to
learn
the
keyboard
shortcut
in
visual
studio
in
order
to
be
more
productive
.
so
i
downloaded
a
document
showing
many
of
the
default
keybindings
in
visual
basic
when
using
the
vs
2008
ide
from
microsoft
:

but
,
when
i
tried
what
they
say
is
the
keyboard
shortcut
to
view
all
open
document
(
ctrl
+
alt
+
down
arrow
)
i
got
a
completely
unexpected
result
on
my
xp
machine
-
my
entire
screen
display
wa
flipped
upside
down
!
was
this
a
prank
by
someone
at
microsoft
?
i
ca
n't
imagine
what
practical
value
this
flipping
of
the
screen
would
have
.
does
anyone
know
what
the
correct
keyboard
shortcut
is
to
view
all
open
document
in
vs
2008
?
oh
and
if
you
try
the
above
shortcut
and
it
flip
your
display
the
way
it
did
mine
,
do
a
ctrl
+
alt
+
up
arrow
to
switch
it
back
.
