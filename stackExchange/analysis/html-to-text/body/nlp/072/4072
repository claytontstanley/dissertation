i
just
did
a
merge
using
something
like
:
svn
merge
-r
67212:67213
http
:
//my.svn.repository/trunk
.
i
only
had
2
file
,
one
of
which
is
a
simple
changelog.
rather
than
just
merging
my
changelog
change
,
it
actually
pulled
mine
plus
some
previous
one
that
were
not
in
the
destination
changelog.
i
noticed
there
wa
a
conflict
when
i
executed
--
dry-run
,
so
i
updated
changelog
,
and
there
wa
still
a
conflict
(
and
i
saw
the
conflict
when
i
did
the
actual
merge
)
.
i
then
later
diffed
on
the
file
i
wa
merging
from
:
svn
diff
-r
67212:67213
changelog
and
i
see
just
the
change
i
had
made
,
so
i
know
that
extra
change
did
n't
get
in
there
somehow.
this
make
me
worried
that
merge
is
not
actually
just
taking
what
i
changed
,
which
is
what
i
would
have
expected.
can
anybody
explain
what
happened
?
update
:
in
response
to
nilobject
:
so
,
i
have
2
file
changed
,
only
changelog
is
relevant
,
the
other
merged
fine.
when
i
go
to
my
regular
trunk
checkout
,
i
do
the
diff
command
above
and
see
:

note
that
the
entry
that
wa
incorrectly
pulled
in
wa
not
in
the
file
i
am
merging
it
to
,
but
yet
it
wa
not
one
of
my
change
and
should
n't
have
been
merged
anyways.
it
wa
easy
to
fix
(
remove
the
extra
line
that
were
n't
part
of
my
change
)
,
but
it
still
make
me
worry
about
merging
automatically
in
svn
.
