so
my
company
us
a
delightfully
buggy
program
called
rational
purify
(
a
a
plugin
to
microsoft
visual
developer
studio
)
to
manage
memory
leak
.
the
program
is
deigned
to
let
you
click
on
a
memory
leak
after
you
have
encountered
it
,
and
then
jump
to
the
line
that
the
leak
occurs
on
.
unfortunately
purify
is
malfunctioning
and
purify
will
not
jump
to
the
place
that
the
leak
occurred
it
only
mention
the
class
and
method
that
the
leak
occurs
in
.
unfortunately
,
sometimes
this
is
about
a
useful
a
hiring
a
guide
to
help
you
hunt
bear
and
having
him
point
to
the
forest
and
tell
you
there
are
bear
there
.
does
anyone
with
purify
experience
have
any
idea
how
i
might
fix
this
problem
or
have
a
good
manual
to
look
though
?
