i
have
designed
database
table
(
normalised
,
on
an
ms
sql
server
)
and
created
a
standalone
window
front
end
for
an
application
that
will
be
used
by
a
handful
of
user
to
add
and
edit
information
.
we
will
add
a
web
interface
to
allow
searching
accross
our
production
area
at
a
later
date
.
i
am
concerned
that
if
two
user
start
editing
the
same
record
then
the
last
to
commit
the
update
would
be
the
'winner
'
and
important
information
may
be
lost
.
a
number
of
solution
come
to
mind
but
i
'm
not
sure
if
i
am
going
to
create
a
bigger
headache
.
do
nothing
and
hope
that
two
user
are
never
going
to
be
editing
the
same
record
at
the
same
time
.
-
might
never
happed
but
what
if
it
doe
?
editing
routine
could
store
a
copy
of
the
original
data
a
well
a
the
update
and
then
compare
when
the
user
ha
finished
editing
.
if
they
differ
show
user
and
comfirm
update
-
would
require
two
copy
of
data
to
be
stored
.
add
last
updated
datetime
column
and
check
it
match
when
we
update
,
if
not
then
show
difference
.
-
requires
new
column
in
each
of
the
relevant
table
.
create
an
editing
table
that
register
when
user
start
editing
a
record
that
will
be
checked
and
prevent
other
user
from
editing
same
record
.
-
would
require
carful
thought
of
program
flow
to
prevent
deadlock
and
record
becoming
locked
if
a
user
crash
out
of
the
program
.
are
there
any
better
solution
or
should
i
go
for
one
of
these
?
