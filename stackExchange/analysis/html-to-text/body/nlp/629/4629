can
do
an
eval
(
``
something
(
)
''
)
;
to
execute
the
code
dynamically
in
javascript
.
is
there
a
way
for
me
to
do
the
same
thing
in

what
i
am
exactly
trying
to
do
is
that
i
have
an
integer
variable
(
say
i
)
and
i
have
multiple
property
by
the
name
:
``
property1
''
,
''
property2
''
,
''
property3
''
etc
.
now
,
i
want
to
perform
some
operation
on
the
``
propertyi
``
property
depending
on
the
value
of
i
.
this
is
really
simple
with
javascript
.
is
there
any
way
to
do
this
with
c
#
