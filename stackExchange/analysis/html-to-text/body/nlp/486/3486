i
have
control
over
the
httpserver
but
not
over
the
applicationserver
or
the
java
applications
sitting
there
but
i
need
to
block
direct
access
to
certain
page
on
those
applications.
precisely
,
i
do
n't
want
user
automating
access
to
form
issuing
direct
get/post
http
request
to
the
appropriate
servlet.
so
,
i
decided
to
block
user
based
on
the
value
of
http_referer.
after
all
,
if
the
user
is
navigating
inside
the
site
,
it
will
have
an
appropriate
http_referer.
well
,
that
wa
what
i
thought.
i
implemented
a
rewrite
rule
in
the
.htaccess
file
that
say
:
rewriteengine
on
#
options
+followsymlinks
rewritecond
%
{
http_referer
}
!
^http
:
//mywebaddress
(
.cl
)
?
/.*
[
nc
]
rewriterule
(
servlet1|servlet2
)
/.+\
?
.+
-
[
f
]
i
expected
to
forbid
access
to
user
that
did
n't
navigate
the
site
but
issue
direct
get
request
to
the
``
servlet1
''
or
``
servlet2
''
servlets
using
querystrings.
but
my
expectation
ended
abruptly
because
the
regular
expression
``
(
servlet1|servlet2
)
/.+\
?
.+
''
did
n't
worked
at
all.
i
get
really
disappointed
when
i
changed
that
expr
to
``
(
servlet1|servlet2
)
/.+
''
and
worked
so
well
that
my
user
were
blocked
no
matter
if
they
navigated
the
site
or
not.
so
,
my
question
is
:
how
do
i
can
accomplish
this
thing
of
not
allowing
``
robot
''
with
direct
access
to
certain
page
if
i
have
no
access/privileges/time
to
modify
the
application
?
