jeff
mentioned
the
concept
of
'progressive
enhancement
'
when
talking
about
using
jquery
to
write
stackoverflow
.
after
a
quick
google
,
i
found
a
couple
of
high-level
discussion
about
it
.
can
anyone
recommend
a
good
place
to
start
a
a
programmer
.
specifically
,
i
have
been
writing
web
apps
in
php
and
would
like
to
use
yui
to
improve
the
page
i
am
writing
,
but
a
lot
of
them
seem
very
javascript
based
,
with
most
of
the
donkey
work
being
done
using
javascript
.
to
me
,
that
seems
a
bit
overkill
,
since
viewing
the
site
without
javascript
will
probably
break
most
of
it
.
anyone
have
some
good
place
to
start
using
this
idea
,
i
do
n't
really
care
about
the
language
.
ideally
,
i
would
like
to
see
how
you
start
creating
the
static
html
first
,
and
then
adding
the
yui
(
or
whatever
ajax
framework
)
to
it
so
that
you
get
the
benefit
of
a
richer
client
?
