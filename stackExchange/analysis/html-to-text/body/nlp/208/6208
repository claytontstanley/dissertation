i
've
got
a
website
that
i
've
just
uploaded
onto
the
interwebs
,
and
it
's
displaying
differently
using
firefox
3.0.1
on
ubuntu
and
winxp.
two
thing
i
've
noticed
on
ubuntu
:
the
favicon
is
missing
the
background
color
is
n't
displaying
(
it
's
set
in
the
stylesheet
)
what
have
i
done
wrong
?
the
css
file
is
being
fetched
under
ubuntu
,
so
why
is
n't
it
applying
all
of
the
stylesheet
,
just
the
bit
it
like
?
and
why
is
n't
the
favicon
displaying
?
are
they
the
same
problem
?
the
answer
on
the
background
color
:
invalid
html.
but
i
'd
love
for
someone
to
explain
why
it
work
under
windows
and
not
ubuntu.
the
answer
on
favicon
:
previously
,
there
wa
no
favicon.
the
browser
cached
the
lack
of
favicon.
clear
the
firefox
cache
,
and
all
is
well
.
