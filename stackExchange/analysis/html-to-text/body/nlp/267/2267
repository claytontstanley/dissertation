i
am
building
a
web
page
to
show
a
customer
what
software
they
purchased
and
to
give
them
a
link
to
download
said
software.
unfortunately
,
the
data
on
what
wa
purchased
and
the
download
information
are
in
separate
database
so
i
ca
n't
just
take
care
of
it
with
join
in
a
query.
the
common
item
is
sku.
i
'll
be
pulling
back
a
list
of
skus
from
the
customer
purchase
database
,
and
on
the
download
table
is
a
comma
deleted
list
of
skus
associated
with
that
download.
my
intention
,
at
the
moment
,
is
to
create
from
this
one
datatable
to
populate
a
gridview.
any
suggestion
on
how
to
do
this
efficiently
would
be
appreciated.
if
it
help
,
i
can
pretty
easily
pull
back
the
data
a
a
dataset
or
a
datareader
,
if
either
one
would
be
better
for
this
purpose
.
