i
'm
so
tired
of
not
having
tabbed
browsing
when
navigating
through
window
explorer.
i
've
tried
a
few
solution
in
the
past
,
but
what
i
really
want
is
just
an
extension/addon/plugin/something
that
let
me
browse
my
file
system
with
tabs.
does
anyone
have
any
good
solution
that
they
have
found
to
do
this
?
alternatively
,
i
'm
willing
to
just
code
it
myself
,
but
i
do
n't
even
know
where
to
begin
...
is
there
any
way
to
legally
modify/customize
the
window
explorer
?
what
language
,
how
do
i
get
started
?
i
can
already
visualize
the
reply
``
no
,
you
're
screwed
,
switch
to
linux
''
(
which
doe
n't
have
tabbed
browsing
either
by
the
way
)
...
