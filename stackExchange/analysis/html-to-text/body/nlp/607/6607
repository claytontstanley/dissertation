i
'm
a
new
windows
programmer
and
i
'm
not
sure
where
i
should
store
user
configurable
application
settings.
i
understand
the
need
to
provide
a
user
friendly
mean
for
the
user
to
change
application
setting
,
like
an
edit
|
settings
form
or
similar.
but
where
should
i
store
the
value
after
the
user
hit
the
apply
button
on
that
form
?
what
are
the
pro
and
con
of
storing
setting
in
the
windows
registry
vs.
storing
them
in
a
local
ini
file
or
config
file
or
similar
?
