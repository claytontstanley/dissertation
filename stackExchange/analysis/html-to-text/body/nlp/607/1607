what
are
the
best
method
for
tracking
and/or
automating
db
schema
change
?
our
team
us
subversion
for
version
control
and
we
've
been
able
to
automate
some
of
our
task
this
way
(
pushing
build
up
to
a
staging
server
,
deploying
tested
code
to
a
production
server
)
but
we
're
still
doing
database
update
manually.
i
would
like
to
find
or
create
a
solution
that
allows
u
to
work
efficiently
across
server
with
different
environment
while
continuing
to
use
subversion
a
a
backend
through
which
code
and
db
update
are
pushed
around
to
various
servers.
many
popular
software
package
include
auto-update
script
which
detect
db
version
and
apply
the
necessary
changes.
is
this
the
best
way
to
do
this
even
on
a
larger
scale
(
across
multiple
project
and
sometimes
multiple
environment
and
language
)
?
if
so
,
is
there
any
existing
code
out
there
that
simplifies
the
process
or
is
it
best
just
to
roll
our
own
solution
?
has
anyone
implemented
something
similar
before
and
integrated
it
into
subversion
post-commit
hook
,
or
is
this
a
bad
idea
?
while
a
solution
that
support
multiple
platform
would
be
preferable
,
we
definitely
need
to
support
the
linux/apache/mysql/php
stack
a
the
majority
of
our
work
is
on
that
platform
.
