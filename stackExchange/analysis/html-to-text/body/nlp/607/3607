i
've
got
totroisesvn
installed
and
have
a
majority
of
my
repository
checking
in
and
out
from
c
:
\subversion\
and
a
couple
checking
in
and
out
from
a
network
share
(
i
forgot
about
this
when
i
originally
posted
this
question
)
.
this
mean
that
i
do
n't
have
a
``
subversion
''
server
per-se.
how
do
i
integrate
tortoisesvn
and
fogbugz
?
