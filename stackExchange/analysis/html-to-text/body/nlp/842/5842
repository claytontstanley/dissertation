two
user
wanted
to
share
the
same
database
,
originally
written
in
ms
access
,
without
conflicting
with
one
another
over
a
single
mdb
file.
i
moved
the
table
from
a
simple
ms
access
database
to
mysql
using
it
migration
toolkit
(
which
work
well
,
by
the
way
)
and
set
up
access
to
link
to
those
table
via
odbc.
so
far
,
i
've
run
into
the
following
:
you
ca
n't
insert/update/delete
row
in
a
table
without
a
primary
key
(
no
surprise
there
)
.
autonumber
field
in
ms
access
must
be
the
primary
key
or
they
'll
just
end
up
a
integer
column
in
mysql
(
natch
,
why
would
n't
it
be
the
pk
?
)
the
table
were
migrated
to
mysql
's
innodb
table
type
,
but
the
access
relationship
did
n't
become
mysql
foreign
key
constraints.
once
the
database
is
in
use
,
can
i
expect
any
other
issue
?
particularly
when
both
user
are
working
in
the
same
table
?
