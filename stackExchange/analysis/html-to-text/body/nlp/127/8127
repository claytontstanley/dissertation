hello
,
i
'm
currently
in
the
process
of
setting
up
a
continuous
integration
environment
at
work
.
we
are
using
visualsvn
server
and
crusiecontrol.net
.
occasionally
a
build
will
fail
and
a
symptom
is
that
there
are
conflict
in
the
cruisecontrol.net
working
copy
.
i
believe
this
is
due
to
the
way
i
've
setup
the
visual
studio
solution
.
hopefully
the
more
project
we
run
in
this
environment
the
better
our
understanding
of
how
to
set
them
up
will
be
so
i
'm
not
questioning
why
the
conflict
happen
at
this
stage
.
to
fix
the
build
i
delete
the
working
copy
and
force
a
new
build
-
this
work
every
time
(
currently
)
.
so
my
question
are
:
is
deleting
the
working
copy
a
valid
part
of
a
continuous
integration
build
process
,
and
how
do
i
go
about
it
?
i
've
tried
solution
including
mstask
and
calling
delete
from
the
command
line
but
i
'm
not
having
any
luck
.
sorry
for
being
so
wordy
-
good
job
this
is
a
beta
:
