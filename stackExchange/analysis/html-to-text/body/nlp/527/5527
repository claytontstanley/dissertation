i
just
saw
a
comment
of
suggesting
j
#
,
and
it
made
me
wonder
...
is
there
a
real
,
beneficial
use
of
j
#
over
java
?
so
,
my
feeling
is
that
the
only
reason
you
would
even
consider
using
j
#
is
that
management
ha
decreed
that
the
company
should
jump
on
the
java
bandwagon
...
and
the
.net
bandwagon.
if
you
use
j
#
,
you
are
effectively
losing
the
biggest
benefit
of
picking
java
...
rich
cross
platform
support.
sure
there
is
mono
,
but
it
's
not
a
richly
supported
or
a
full
featured
right
?
i
remember
hearing
forms
are
not
fully
(
perhaps
at
all
)
supported.
i
'm
not
trying
to
bash
.net
here
,
i
'm
just
saying
,
if
you
are
going
to
go
the
microsoft
route
,
why
not
just
use
c
#
?
if
you
are
going
to
go
the
java
route
,
why
would
j
#
enter
the
picture
?
i
'm
hoping
to
find
some
real
world
case
here
,
so
please
especially
respond
if
you
've
actually
used
j
#
in
a
real
project
,
and
why
.
