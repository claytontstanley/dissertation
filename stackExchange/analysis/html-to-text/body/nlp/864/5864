my
company
is
using
me
a
a
sort
of
guinea
pig
for
having
developer
on
both
side
of
the
us.
the
main
office
is
located
in
denver
,
and
i
'm
in
louisville
,
ky.
i
've
been
trying
to
come
up
with
idea
to
make
the
remote
development
experience
line
up
better
with
the
experience
in
the
main
office.
it
obviously
will
never
line
up
perfectly
,
but
i
think
we
can
still
make
it
better.
for
reference
,
we
work
primarily
in
java
with
eclipse
being
the
preferred
ide.
so
far
i
've
come
up
with
:
instant
messaging/skype
-
can
act
a
both
a
basic
in/out/busy
system
and
a
quick
communication
system.
development
portal
-
a
simple
web
page
with
link
to
important
documentation
or
reference
for
package
we
use
in
each
project
and
any
other
useful
information.
cruise
control
-
so
we
do
n't
waste
a
much
time
pulling
down
and
then
worrying
about
broken
builds.
vnc
-
for
the
time
i
want
to
show
someone
code
that
ha
no
business
being
checked
into
git
yet
,
or
when
i
need
to
walk
through
a
series
of
screen
for
critique/advice.
what
other
tool
are
available
that
we
can
use
to
help
me
feel
le
like
i
'm
stranded
on
a
desert
island
?
