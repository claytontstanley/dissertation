as
i
learn
more
and
more
about
oop
,
and
start
to
implement
various
design
pattern
,
i
keep
coming
back
to
case
where
people
are
hating
on
active
record
.
often
,
people
say
that
it
doe
n't
scale
well
(
citing
twitter
a
their
prime
example
)
--
but
nobody
actually
explains
why
it
doe
n't
scale
well
;
and
/
or
how
to
achieve
the
pro
of
ar
without
the
con
(
via
a
similar
but
different
pattern
?
)
hopefully
this
wo
n't
turn
into
a
holy
war
about
design
pattern
--
all
i
want
to
know
is
**specifically**
what
's
wrong
with
active
record.
if
it
doe
n't
scale
well
,
why
not
?
what
other
problem
doe
it
have
?
