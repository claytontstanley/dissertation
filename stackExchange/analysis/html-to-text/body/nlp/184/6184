when
you
subscribe
to
an
event
on
an
object
from
within
a
form
,
you
are
essentially
handing
over
control
of
your
callback
method
to
the
event
source.
you
have
no
idea
whether
that
event
source
will
choose
to
trigger
the
event
on
a
different
thread.
the
problem
is
that
when
the
callback
is
invoked
,
you
can
not
assume
that
you
can
make
update
control
on
your
form
because
sometimes
those
control
will
throw
an
expection
if
the
event
callback
wa
called
on
a
thread
different
than
the
thread
the
form
wa
run
on
.
