is
there
a
trivial
,
or
at
least
moderately
straight-forward
way
to
generate
territory
map
(
e.g.
risk
)
?
i
have
looked
in
the
past
and
the
best
i
could
find
were
vague
reference
to
voronoi
diagrams.
an
example
of
a
voronoi
diagram
is
here
.
these
hold
promise
,
but
i
guess
i
have
n't
seen
any
straight-forward
way
of
rendering
these
,
yet
alone
holding
them
in
some
form
of
data
structure
to
treat
each
territory
a
an
object.
another
approach
that
hold
promise
is
flood
fill
,
but
again
i
'm
unsure
on
the
best
way
to
start
with
this
approach.
any
advice
would
be
much
appreciated
.
