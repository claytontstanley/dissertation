since
the
wmi
class
win32_operatingsystem
only
includes
osarchitecture
in
windows
vista
,
i
quickly
wrote
up
a
method
using
the
registry
to
try
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
current
system
is
a
32
or
64bit
system.
private
boolean
is64bitoperatingsystem
(
)
{
registrykey
localenvironment
=
registry.localmachine.opensubkey
(
``
system\\currentcontrolset\\control\\session
manager\\environment
''
)
;
string
processorarchitecture
=
(
string
)
localenvironment.getvalue
(
``
processor_architecture
''
)
;
if
(
processorarchitecture.equals
(
``
x86
''
)
)
{
return
false
;
}
else
{
return
true
;
}
}
it
's
worked
out
pretty
well
for
u
so
far
,
but
i
'm
not
sure
how
much
i
like
looking
through
the
registry.
is
this
a
pretty
standard
practice
or
is
there
a
better
method
?
edit
:
wow
,
that
code
look
a
lot
prettier
in
the
preview.
i
'll
consider
linking
to
a
pastebin
or
something
,
next
time
.
