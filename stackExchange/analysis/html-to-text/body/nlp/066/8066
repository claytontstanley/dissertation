over
the
past
few
year
i
've
changed
from
having
a
long
flowing
page
of
control
that
i
hid/showed
to
using
a
lot
of
user
control
.
i
've
always
had
a
bit
of
a
discussion
between
co-worker
on
best
practice
.
should
you
have
property
that
you
populate
,
or
use
paramterized
sub
's
to
load
the
information
in
your
control
?
part
of
my
fear
of
using
paramteter
's
is
the
fact
that
i
can
not
make
sure
that
everything
will
be
populated
.
what
is
the
basic
rule
's
for
using
interface
?
i
've
never
created
one
.
and
should
i
try
this
,
or
stay
with
a
``
sub
load
''
?
