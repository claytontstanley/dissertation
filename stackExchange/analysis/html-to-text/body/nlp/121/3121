i
'm
running
32-bit
windows
2003
r2
in
vmware
6.0.3
on
my
windows
xp
32-bit
host
os
.
i
have
run
all
the
windows
update
,
but
have
n't
done
any
other
tweaking
.
about
once
every
hour
(
but
not
quite
on
a
schedule
)
my
cpu
usage
go
to
100
%
,
slowing
everything
down
for
about
1
minute
.
when
i
can
get
taskmgr
up
,
i
see
that
usually
a
process
called
``
system
''
is
using
most
of
the
cpu
.
occasionally
taskmgr
itself
is
using
up
almost
all
of
it
.
what
is
causing
this
,
and
how
can
i
avoid
it
?
the
host
machine
is
an
older
pentium
d
with
3
gig
ram
.
the
vm
is
running
from
a
relatively
fast
sata
drive
.
memory
usage
in
either
the
host
or
the
guest
doe
n't
seem
to
be
a
factor
in
whether
or
not
these
slowdown
will
occur
.
thanks
!
