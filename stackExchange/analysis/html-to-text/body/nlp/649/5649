does
anyone
know
of
any
good
tool
(
i
'm
looking
for
ides
,
primarily
)
to
write
assembly
on
the
mac
...
xcode
is
a
little
cumbersome
to
me
.
also
,
on
the
intel
macs
,
can
i
use
generic
x86
asm
?
or
is
there
a
modified
instruction
set
?
any
information
about
post
intel
also
:
i
know
that
on
window
,
asm
can
run
in
an
emulated
environment
created
by
the
os
to
let
the
code
think
it
's
running
on
it
own
dedicated
machine
...
doe
osx
provide
the
same
thing
?
