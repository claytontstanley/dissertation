when
writing
a
t-sql
script
that
i
plan
on
re-running
,
often
time
i
use
temporary
table
to
store
temporary
data
.
since
the
temp
table
is
created
on
the
fly
,
i
'd
like
to
be
able
to
drop
that
table
only
if
it
exists
(
before
i
create
it
)
.
i
'll
post
the
method
that
i
use
,
but
i
'd
like
to
see
if
there
is
a
better
way
.
