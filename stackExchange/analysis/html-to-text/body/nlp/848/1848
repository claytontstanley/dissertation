i
am
currently
working
on
a
project
and
my
goal
is
to
locate
text
in
an
image.
ocr'ing
the
text
is
not
my
intention
a
of
yet.
i
want
to
basically
obtain
the
bound
of
text
within
an
image.
i
am
using
the
aforge.net
imaging
component
for
manipulation.
any
assistance
in
some
sense
or
another
?

:
i
've
since
went
along
another
route
in
my
project.
however
i
did
attempt
to
obtain
text
using
modi
(
microsoft
office
document
imaging
)
.
it
allows
you
to
ocr
an
image
and
pull
text
from
it
with
some
ease.
thanks
.
