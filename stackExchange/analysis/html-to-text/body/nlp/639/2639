i
've
used
a
wordpress
blog
and
a
screwturn
wiki
(
at
two
separate
job
)
to
store
private
,
company-specific
kb
info
,
but
i
'm
looking
for
something
that
wa
created
to
be
a
knowledge
base.
specifically
,
i
'd
like
to
see
:
free/low
cost
simple
method
for
user
to
subscribe
to

or
just
section
)
to
get
update

do

to
certain
page
for
certain

ability
ability
to
rate
and

i
liked
using
the
wordpress
blog
because
it
allowed
me
to
use
live
writer
to
add/edit
article
and
image
,
but
it
did
n't
have
page
versioning
(
that
i
could
see
)
.
i
like
using
screwturn
wiki
because
of
it
's
ability
to
track
article
version
,
and
i
like
it
's
clean
look
,
but
some
non-technical
people
balk
at
the
input
and
editing
.
