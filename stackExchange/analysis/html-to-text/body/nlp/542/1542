for
people
who
work
on
very
small
team
,
or
by
themselves
,
or
on
team
where
they
are
by
far
the
best
developer
and
have
a
need
to
learn
from
someone
better
than
them
,
are
there
any
online
resources/methods
for
doing
some
sort
of
peer
code
review
?
i
used
to
be
pretty
active
in
the
online
art
community
(
specifically
drawing
anime
)
and
there
were
all
sort
of
site
where
you
could
just
post
picture
for
critique
and
comments.
i
've
never
seen
anything
like
that
for
programmers.
i
'm
thinking
of
somewhere
where
you
could
post
object
architecture
plan
,
db
design
plan
,
or
even
just
straight
code
for
others
to
look
at
,
learn
from
,
and
critique
and
comment
on.
anyone
know
of
anything
like
that
anywhere
(
preferably
focused
towards
php
,
but
anything
will
do
,
and
even
a
non-free
site
would
be
ok
)
?
thanks
!
note
:
yes
,
i
am
aware
that
this
could
have
security
implication
,
but
security
by
obscurity
is
the
worst
security
,
and
posting
your
code
would
actually
help
flush
out
potential
security
issue
