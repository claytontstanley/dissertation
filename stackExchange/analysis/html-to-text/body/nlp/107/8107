when
i
have
two
mysql
server
that
have
different
job
(
holding
different
database
)
but
want
to
be
able
to
use
one
of
them
to
slip
in
when
the
other
one
fails
,
what
would
you
suggest
how
i
keep
the
data
on
both
of
them
equal
``
close
to
realtime
''
?
obviously
it
's
not
possible
to
make
a
full
database
dump
every
x
minutes.
i
've
read
about
the
binary
log
,
is
that
the
way
that
i
need
to
go
?
will
that
not
slow
down
the
fallback
server
a
lot
?
is
there
a
way
to
not
include
some
table
in
the
binary
log
-
where
it
doe
n't
matter
that
the
data
ha
changed
?
