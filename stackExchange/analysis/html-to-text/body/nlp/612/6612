on
a
recent
java
project
,
we
needed
a
free
java
based
real-time
data
plotting
utility.
after
much
searching
,
we
found
this
tool
called
the
scientific
graphics
toolkit
or
sgt
from
noaa.
it
seemed
pretty
robust
,
but
we
found
out
that
it
wa
n't
terribly
configurable.
or
at
least
not
configurable
enough
to
meet
our
needs.
we
ended
up
digging
very
deeply
into
the
java
code
and
reverse
engineering
the
code
and
changing
it
all
around
to
make
the
plot
tool
look
and
act
the
way
we
wanted
it
to
look
and
act.
of
course
,
this
killed
any
chance
for
future
upgrade
from
noaa.
so
what
free
or
cheap
java
based
data
plotting
tool
or
library
do
you
use
?
followup
:
thanks
for
the
jfreechart
suggestions.
i
checked
out
their
website
and
it
look
like
a
very
nice
data
charting
and
plotting
utility.
i
should
have
made
it
clear
in
my
original
question
that
i
wa
looking
specifically
to
plot
real-time
data.
i
corrected
my
question
above
to
make
that
point
clear.
it
appears
that
jfreechart
support
for
live
data
is
marginal
at
best
,
though
.
any
other
suggestion
out
there
?
