i
'm
curious
about
what
type
of
tool
and
specific
tool
people
ca
n't
live
without
in
their
daily
work.
anyone
interested
,
please
post
up
to
10
category
of
tool
you
ca
n't
live
without
,
and
then
with
it
a
many
specific
implementation
of
that
tool
that
you
use.
the
reason
for
this
category/implementation
split
is
to
compensate
for
the
disparate
background
of
all
the
reader
here.
i
'll
try
to
collate
response
back
into
this
question
a

in.
here
are

get

started

professional
programmer

this
point
)
.
edit
:
while
i
think
my
question
wa
asked
from
a
different
pov
,
it
look
like
the
answer
in
the
thread

be
along
the
same
line
a
this
one.

or
not
