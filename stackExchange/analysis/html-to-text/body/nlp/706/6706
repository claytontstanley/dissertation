i
noticed
a
a
jr
programmer
,
bright
eyed
and
excited
about
new
technology
,
is
the
serious
amount
of
loathing
windows
developer
have
for
windows
platform
.
it
's
starting
to
take
it
's
toll
.
really
.
my
question
is
:
how
do
you
deal
with
the
constant
carcinogen
?
especially
when
you
are
afraid
to
publicly
disagree
with
everyone
on
your
team
.
how
do
you
say
``
no
,
give
me
a
vista
box
''
and
``
no
,
the
problem
is
n't
vista
it
's
the
fact
this
dependency
we
have
ha
n't
been
updated
...
no
ha
n't
been
compiled
since
2004
and
wa
written
for
windows
me
''
.
i
'm
in
it
for
the
love
of
the
game
,
not
the
money
,
but
some
day
i
want
to
wait
table
instead
.
i
swear
,
being
a
punk
rocker
getting
egg
thrown
at
me
,
i
had
more
self
respect
.
note
:
i
do
n't
want
to
start
a
religious
``
m
$
suxor
!
!
11one
''
debate
,
we
all
know
there
are
some
thing
that
could
be
better
.
i
'm
trying
to
avoid
such
thing
in
the
work
place
and
really
do
n't
want
to
get
involved
with
it
here
.
though
a
thought
out
constructive
motivator
for
some
other
platform
is
welcome
.
