on
one
linux
server
running
apache
and
php
5
,
we
got
multiple
virtual
hosts
with
separate
logfiles
and
everything.
the
only
thing
we
can
not
seem
to
separate
between
virtual
host
is
the
php
error_log.
overriding
this
setting
in
the
<
location
>
of
the
httpd.conf
doe
not
seem
to
do
anything.
did
i
overlook
something
?
is
there
a
way
to
have
separate
php
error_logs
for
each
virtual
host
?
