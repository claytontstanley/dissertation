far
,
my
favorite
programming
language
ha
been
python
,
hand
down
,
but
i
've
been
hearing
a
number
of
good
thing
about
ruby
from
various
people
i
hold
in
good
regard
,
so
let
me
put
it
to
you
:
why
should
i
learn
ruby
?
please
do
not
post
something
to
the
effect
of
``
because
it
is
awesome
''
or
``
it
's
better
than
language
x
because
...
''
i
do
n't
want
a
war
on
my
hands.
i
'm
looking
for
concrete
example
of
what
make
