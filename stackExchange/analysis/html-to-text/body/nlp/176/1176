i
have
just
recently
started
to
study
ruby
,
and
in
lieu
of
jeff
's
advice
over
the
weekend
...
stop
theorizing
.
write
lot
of
software
.
learn
from
your
mistake
.
...
i
wa
interested
in
honing
my
skill
while
helping
out
the
open
source
community
the
process
so
i
thought
i
'd
ask
if
anyone
have
any
suggestion
for
cool/interesting
open
source
projects
written
in
ruby
that
you
know
of
or
are
involved
in
.
