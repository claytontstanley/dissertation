i
have
an
application
that
display
an
image
inside
of
a
winforms
picturebox
control.
the
sizemode
of
the
control
is
set
to
zoom
so
that
the
image
contained
in
the
picture
box
will
be
displayed
in
an
aspect-correct
way
regardless
of
the
dimension
of
the
picturebox.
this
is
great
for
the
visual
appearance
of
the
application
because
you
can
size
the
window
however
you
want
and
the
image
will
always
be
displayed
using
it
best
fit.
unfortunately
,
i
also
need
to
handle
mouse
click
event
on
the
picture
box
and
need
to
be
able
to
translate
from
screen-space
coordinate
to
image-space
coordinates.
it
look
like
it
's
easy
to
translate
from
screen
space
to
control
space
,
but
i
do
n't
see
any
obvious
way
to
translate
from
control
space
to
image
space
(
i.e.
the
pixel
coordinate
in
the
source
image
that
ha
been
scaled
in
the
picture
box
)
.
is
there
an
easy
way
to
do
this
,
or
should
i
just
duplicate
the
scaling
math
that
they
're
using
internally
to
position
the
image
and
do
the
translation
myself
?
