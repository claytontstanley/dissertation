basically
,
i
've
written
an
api
to
www.thetvdb.com
in
python.
the
current
code
can
be
found
here
.
it
grab
data
from
the
api
a
requested
,
and
ha
to
store
the
data
somehow
,
and
make
it
available
by
doing
:
print
tvdbinstance
[
1
]
[
23
]
[
'episodename
'
]
#
get
the
name
of
episode
23
of
season
1
what
is
the
``
best
''
way
to
abstract
this
data
within
the
tvdb
(
)
class
?
i
originally
used
a
extended
dict
(
)
that
automatically
created
sub-dicts
(
so
you
could
do
x
[
1
]
[
2
]
[
3
]
[
4
]
=
``
something
''
without
having
to
do
if
x
[
1
]
.has_key
(
2
)
:
x
[
1
]
[
2
]
=
[
]
and
so
on
)
then
i
just
stored
the
data
by
doing
self.data
[
show_id
]
[
season_number
]
[
episode_number
]
[
attribute_name
]
=
``
something
''
this
worked
okay
,
but
there
wa
no
easy
way
of
checking
if
x
[
3
]
[
24
]
wa
supposed
to
exist
or
not
(
so
i
could
n't
raise
the
season_not_found
exception
)
currently
it
's
using
four
classes.
showcontainer
,
show
,
season
and
episode.
each
one
is
a
very
basic
dict
,
which
i
can
easily
add
extra
functionality
in
(
the
search
(
)
function
on
show
(
)
for
example
)
.
each
ha
a
__setitem__
,
__getitem_
and
has_key
this
work
mostly
fine
,
i
can
check
in
shows
if
it
ha
that
season
in
it
's
self.data
dict
,
if
not
,
raise
season_not_found.
check
in
season
(
)
if
it
ha
that
episode
and
so
on.
the
problem
now
is
it
's
presenting
itself
a
a
dict
,
but
doe
n't
have
all
the
functionality
,
and
because
i
'm
overriding
the
_getitem_
and
_setitem_
function
,
it
's
easy
to
accidently
recursively
call
_getitem_
(
so
i
'm
not
sure
if
extending
the
dict
class
will
cause
problem
)
the
other
slight
problem
is
adding
data
into
the
dict
is
a
lot
more
work
than
the
old
ddict
method
(
which
wa
self.data
[
seas_no
]
[
ep_no
]
[
'attribute
'
]
=
'something
'
)
.
see
_setitem
and
_setdata.
it
's
not
too
bad
,
since
it
's
currently
only
a
read-only
api
interface
(
so
the
user
of
the
api
should
only
ever
retrieve
data
,
not
add
more
)
,
but
it
's
hardly..
elegant..
i
think
the
series-of-classes
system
is
probably
the
best
way
,
but
doe
anyone
have
a
better
idea
for
storing
the
data
?
and
would
extending
the
showcontainer/etc
class
with
dict
cause
problem
?
