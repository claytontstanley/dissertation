i
am
building
a
server
control
that
will
search
our
db
and
return
result
.
the
server
control
is
contains
an
asp
:
panel
.
i
have
set
the
default

on
the
panel
equal
to
my
button
id
and
have
set
the
form
default
button
equal
to
my
button
id
.
on
the
panel
:
mypanel.defaultbutton
=
searchbutton.id
on
the
control
:
me.page.form.defaultbutton
=
searchbutton.uniqueid
works
fine
in
ie
&
safari
i
can
type
a
search
term
and
hit
the
enter
key
