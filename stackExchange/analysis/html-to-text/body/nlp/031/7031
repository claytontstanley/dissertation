i
have
been
using
php
and
javascript
for
building
my
dad
website.
he
want
to
incorporate
a
login
system
into
his
website.
i
have
the
design
for
the
login
system
using
php
,
my
problem
is
how
do
i
show
button
if
the
person
is
logged
in.
for
example
-
you
have
home
,
products
,
about
us
,
and
contact.
well
i
want
to
have
button
for
dealer
,
distributor
,
and
maybe
other
information
if
the
user
is
logged
in.
so
i
will
have
home
,
products
,
about
us
,
contacts
,
dealer
(
if
dealer
login
)
,
distributor
(
if
distributor
login
)
,
and
so
forth.
would
javascript
be
a
good
way
to
do
this
or
would
php
,
maybe
even
both.
using
javascript
to
show
and
hide
button
,
and
php
to
check
to
see
which
button
to
show
.
