i
'm
trying
out
the
following
query
:
select
a
,
b
,
c
from
table
where
field
like
'query
%
'
union
select
a
,
b
,
c
from
table
where
field
like
'
%
query
'
union
select
a
,
b
,
c
from
table
where
field
like
'
%
query
%
'
group
by
b
order
by
b
asc
limit
5
that
's
three
query
stuck
together
,
kindasorta.
however
,
the
result
set
that
come
back
reflects
result
from
query
#
3
before
result
from
query
#
1
(
undesired
)
.
is
there
any
way
to
prioritize
these
so
that
result
come
a
all
for
query
#
1
,
then
all
for
query
#
2
then
all
for
query
#
3
?
i
do
n't
want
to
do
this
in
php
just
yet
(
not
to
mention
having
to
control
for
result
that
showed
up
in
the
first
query
not
to
show
in
the
second
and
so
forth
)
.
