we
have
been
using
crusisecontrol
for
quite
a
while
with
nunit
and
nant
.
for
a
recent
project
we
decided
to
use
the
testing
framework
that
come
with
visual
studio
,
which
so
far
ha
been
adequate
.
i
'm
attempting
to
get
the
solution
running
in
cruise
control
.
i
've
finally
got
the
build
itself
to
work
;
however
,
i
have
been
unable
to
get
any
test
to
show
up
in
the
cruisecontrol
interface
despite
adding
custom
build
task
and
component
designed
to
do
just
that
.
does
anyone
have
a
definitive
link
out
there
to
instruction
on
getting
this
set
up
?
