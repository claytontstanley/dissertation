so
a
window
exe
file
ha
access
to
the
command
string
which
invoked
it
,
including
it
path
and
filename
.
eg
.
``
c
:
\myapp\myapp.exe
--
help
''
.
but
this
is
not
so
for
a
dll
invoked
via
loadlibrary
.
does
anyone
know
of
a
way
for
a
dll
to
find
out
what
it
path
and
filename
is
?
specifically
i
'm
interested
in
a
delphi
solution
,
but
i
suspect
that
the
answer
would
be
pretty
much
the
same
for
any
language
.
