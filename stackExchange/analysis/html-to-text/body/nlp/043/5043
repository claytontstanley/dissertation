what
are
the
known
case
where
a
programmer
(
just
by
programming
)
can
become
rich.
a
programmer
that
started
a
company
,
i
think
,
doe
n't
count
except
if
he/she
wa
not
the
ceo
but
the
leader
programmer.
this
question
,
at
first
,
may
seems
silly
but
it
so
fundamental
a
anyone
else
that
you
'll
see
in
this
site.
in
a
given
moment
,
a
programmer
must
do
the
choice
between
crossover
to
a
managerial
role
or
keep
programming
just
for
the
fun
of
it.
and
this
choice
affect
everything
else.
i
wa
surprised
at
first
not
to
see
this
very
question
being
posted
by
younger
visitor
but
it
seems
that
,
until
today
(
20080807
)
everyone
is
only
focused
in
technical
facts.
i
firmly
believe
that
a
programmer
must
develop
also
``
soft
''
skill
and
this
kind
of
question
will
be
asked
by
newbie
anyway
(
soon
or
later
)
.
i
wonder
if
joel
and
jeff
ha
addressed
this
topic
before
...
and
i
question
which
is
the
business
model
for
stackoverflow
?
updates
:
adam
say
that
anyone
that
know
how
to
answer
this
question
will
not
be
answering.
but
that
is
exactly
against
the
soul
of
my
question.
i
want
to
keep
programming
,
even
testing
and
documenting
mind
you
!
,
but
also
i
want
to
go
on
vacation
anytime.
i
want
to
share
my
wealth
with
my
friend
programmer
and
so.
greg
:
i
'm
35
year
old
and
i
do
n't
think
is
naive
to
ask
yourself
what
will
be
your
source
of
wealth.
maybe
the
question
can
be
rephrased
to
``
what
are
the
thing
i
must
do
to
keep
being
a
well
paid
programmer
by
age
60
''
but
,
you
surely
realize
,
that
's
implicit
in
the
much
more
visible
question
that
i
posted.
ballon
:
it
seems
like
you
read
those
book
(
there
are
three
by
same
author
for
the
same
subject
,
right
?
)
can
you
tell
u
if
you
're
rich
?
tom
:
that
's
my
point.
from
my
pov
it
seems
like
the
only
way
to
increase
your
paycheck
is
by
climbing
the
corporate
ladder
,
that
's
not
being
a
programmer
anymore.
just
for
the
record
:
i
did
just
that
but
i
miss
you
guy
!
and
i
'm
pretty
sure
that
the
formula
involve
to
always
learn
a
much
a
you
can
from
others
,
that
's
explain
pretty
well
why
i
ask.
edit
:
bad
news
for
you
:
i
've
been
working
for
leader
company
for
twelve
year
and
,
although
i
like
to
think
of
myself
a
programmer
,
i
'm
not
a
formal
programmer
for
eight
years.
edit
,
sorry
me
:
i
'm
doing
it
pretty
well
...
but
i
'm
not
rich.
are
your
friend
rich
?
modesty
:
i
want
to
very
proud
of
my
achievement
and
for
a
weird
reason
,
i
prefer
to
be
honest.
avenger
:
i
wa
tempted
to
accept
your
reply
a
the
truer
one
but
i
realized
that
we
're
doing
this
just
for
fun
(
it
's
not
obvious
?
)
so
let
's
keep
it
rolling.
besides
that
i
want
to
keep
the
foot
on
the
ground
:
p
i
'm
already
maintaining
my
family
but
i
do
n't
have
money
to
do
flight
to
the
international
space
station
ramiro
:
muchas
gracias
!
that
's
the
kind
of
info
i
think
we
all
need
to
keep
our
morale
high
!
well
,
it
seems
david
ha
the
right
answer.
ballon
:
i
wa
an
enterprenuer
(
that
mean
i
run
a
startup
before
the
word
wa
used
a
it
's
used
today
)
and
started
my
own
business
at
age
21.
we
grew
very
rapidly.
almost
a
fast
a
we
broke
:
p
grom
:
its
not
about
to
accumulate
wealth.
it
's
about
to
keep
being
a
programmer
(
not
a
very
good
one
in
my
case
)
but
enjoying
luxury
like
flight
to
the
international
space
station
,
your
own
basketball
team
,
your
own
archeological
team
,
your
own
country
,
or
whatever
your
can
dream
of
.
