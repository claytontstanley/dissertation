i
have
a
client-server
app
where
the
client
is
on
a
windows
wobile
6
device
,
written
in
c++
and
the
server
is
on
full
windows
and
written
in
c
#
.
originally
,
i
only
needed
it
to
send
message
from
the
client
to
the
server
,
with
the
server
only
ever
sending
back
an
acknowledgment
that
it
received
the
message.
now
,
i
would
like
to
update
it
so
that
the
server
can
actually
send
a
message
to
the
client
to
request
data.
as
i
currently
have
it
set
up
so
the
client
is
only
in
receive
mode
after
it
sends
data
to
the
server
,
this
doe
n't
allow
for
the
server
to
send
a
request
at
any
time.
i
would
have
to
wait
for
client
data.
my
first
thought
would
be
to
create
another
thread
on
the
client
with
a
separate
open
socket
,
listening
for
server
request
...
just
like
the
server
already
ha
in
respect
the
the
client.
is
there
a
way
,
within
the
same
thread
and
using
the
same
socket
,
to
all
the
server
to
send
request
at
any
time
?
can
you
use
something
to
the
affect
of
waitformultipleobjects
(
)
and
pas
it
a
recieve
buffer
and
an
event
that
tell
it
there
is
data
to
be
sent
?
