my
company
currently
us
cvs
a
our
defacto
standard
for
source
control.
i
've
heard
many
people
say
svn
is
better
,
and
i
know
that
it
's
newer
,
but
other
than
that
am
not
sure
of
the
benefits.
i
should
note
we
use
primarily
java
and
eclipse
if
that
matters.
i
guess
what
i
'm
looking
for
is
a
good
,
succinct
comparison
of
the
2
noting
advantage
and
disadvantes
of
using
both
in
a
java
eclipse
development
environment
?
