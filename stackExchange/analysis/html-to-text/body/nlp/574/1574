i
realise
purist
would
say
``
use
the
command-line
''
but
this
is
the
age
of
ubuntu
and
since
i
spend
most
of
my
time
behind
a
proxy
server
i
find
it
easier
to
configure
and
use
putty
on
windows
than
configure
ssh
with
connect.c
i
also
realise
putty
is
available
on
linux
but
it
seems
to
use
some
weird
gui
widget
set
that
is
rather
nasty
to
use
.
so
,
is
there
a
nice
gtk
front-end
for
ssh
that
i
could
download
and
use
on
linux
in
gnome
?
