i
often
have
a
dictionary
of
key
&
value
and
need
to
sort
it
by
value.
for
example
,
i
have
a
hash
of
word
and
their
frequency
,
and
want
to
order
them
by
frequency.
there
's
sortedlist
which
is
good
for
a
single
value
(
frequency
)
,
but
i
want
to
map
it
back
to
the
word.
sorteddictionary
order
by
key
,
not
value.
some
resort
to
a
custom
class
,
but
what
's
the
cleanest
way
?
