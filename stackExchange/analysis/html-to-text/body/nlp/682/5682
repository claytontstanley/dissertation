i
'm
not
sure
if
it
's
my
system
,
although
i
have
n't
done
anything
unusual
with
it
,
but
i
've
started
noticing
incorrectly
rendered
character
popping
up
in
web
page
,
text-files
,
like
this
:
i
have
a
hunch
it
's
a
related
to
the
fairly
recent
trend
to
use
unicode
for
everything
,
which
is
a
good
thing
i
think
,
combined
with
font
that
do
n't
support
all
possible
characters.
so
,
doe
anyone
know
what
's
causing
these
blip
(
am
i
right
?
)
,
and
how
do
i
stop
this
showing
up
in
my
own
content
?
