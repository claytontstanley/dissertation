i
have
a
mysql
table
with
approximately
3000
row
per
user.
one
of
the
column
is
a
datetime
field
,
which
is
mutable
,
so
the
row
are
n't
in
chronological
order.
i
'd
like
to
visualize
the
time
distribution
in
a
chart
,
so
i
need
a
number
of
individual
datapoints.
20
datapoints
would
be
enough.
i
could
do
this
:
select
timefield
from
entry
where
uid
=
?
order
by
timefield
;
and
look
at
every
150th
row.
or
i
could
do
20
separate
query
and
use
limit
1
and
offset.
but
there
must
be
a
more
efficient
solution
