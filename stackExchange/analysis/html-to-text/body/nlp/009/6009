let
's
say
you
have
a
typical
web
app
and
with
a
file
configuration.whatever
.
every
developer
working
on
the
project
will
have
one
version
for
their
dev
box
,
there
will
be
a
dev
,
prod
and
stage
version
.
how
do
you
deal
with
this
in
source
control
?
not
check
in
this
file
at
all
,
check
it
with
different
name
or
do
something
fancy
altogether
?
