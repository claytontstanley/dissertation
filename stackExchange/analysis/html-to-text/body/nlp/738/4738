i
'm
developing
a
data
access
component
that
will
be
used
in
a
website
that
contains
a
mix
of
classic
asp
and
asp.net
page
,
and
need
a
good
way
to
manage
it
configuration
settings.
i
'd
like
to
use
a
custom
configurationsection
,
and
for
the
asp.net
page
this
work
great.
but
when
the
component
is
called
via
com
interop
from
a
classic
asp
page
,
the
component
is
n't
running
in
the
context
of
an
asp.net
request
and
therefore
ha
no
knowledge
of
web.config.
is
there
a
way
to
tell
the
configurationmanager
to
just
load
the
configuration
from
an
arbitrary
path
(
e.g.
``
..\web.config
''
if
my
assembly
is
in
the
/bin
folder
)
?
if
there
is
then
i
'm
thinking
my
component
can
fall
back
to
that
if
the
default
configurationmanager.getsection
return
null
for
my
custom
section.
any
other
approach
to
this
would
be
welcome
!
