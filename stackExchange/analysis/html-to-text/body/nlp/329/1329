i
need
to
copy
hundred
of
gig
of
random
file
around
on
my
computer
and
am
pretty
leery
of
using
the
vanilla
file
copy
built
into
windows
.
i
do
n't
want
it
to
hang
on
a
``
are
you
sure
?
``
,
``
are
you
really
sure
?
``
,
``
even
zip
file
?
``
,
``
surely
not
read-only
file
too
!
``
loop
a
soon
a
i
step
away
.
i
do
n't
want
it
to
work
for
hour
and
then
stop
unexpectedly
:
``
someone
once
opened
this
file
and
so
i
wo
n't
copy
it
!
``
and
then
cancel
the
whole
copy
or
just
quit
with
no
indication
of
what
wa
done
and
what
work
remains
.
what
file
management
program
do
you
have
experience
with
?
which
do
you
recommend
?
this
question
is
related
to
my
other
question
:
how
can
i
use
an
old
pata
hard
disk
drive
on
my
newer
sata-only
computer
?
