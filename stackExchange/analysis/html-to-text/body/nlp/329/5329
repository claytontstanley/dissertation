i
'm
currently
evaluating
the
msf
for
cmmi
process
template
under
tfs
for
use
on
my
development
team
,
and
i
'm
having
trouble
understanding
the
need
for
separate
bug
and
change
request
work
item
types.
i
understand
that
it
is
beneficial
to
be
able
to
differentiate
between
bug
(
error
)
and
change
request
(
changing
requirement
)
when
generating
reports.
in
our
current
system
,
however
,
we
only
have
a
single
type
of
change
request
and
just
use
a
field
to
indicate
whether
it
is
a
bug
,
requirement
change
,
etc
(
this
field
can
be
used
to
build
report
query
)
.
what
are
the
benefit
of
having
a
separate
workflow
for
bug
?
i
'm
also
confused
by
the
fact
that
developer
can
submit
work
against
a
bug
or
a
change
request
--
i
thought
the
intended
workflow
wa
for
bug
to
generate
change
request
which
are
what
the
developer
reference
when
making
change
.
