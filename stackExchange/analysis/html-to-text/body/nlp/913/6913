is
there
a
good
way
to
create
a
form
in
vb6
that
can
easily
be
embedded
inside
other
form
?
on
a
few
occasion
recently
,
i
've
wanted
to
design
and
code
a
form
object
that
i
could
plug
into
several
other
``
parent
''
forms.
my
goal
is
to
create
a
centralized
piece
of
code
for
managing
several
ui
component
in
a
particular
way
,
and
then
be
able
to
use
that
(
both
the
ui
layout
and
the
logic
)
in
more
than
one
place.
i
'm
certainly
willing
to
use
code
(
rather
than
the
design
view
)
to
load
the
child
form.
the
best
i
've
come
up
with
so
far
is
to
pull
all
of
the
interesting
logic
for
the
child
form
into
a
class
module
,
and
have
each
parent
form
lay
out
the
ui
(
in
a
picture
control
,
perhaps
)
and
pas
that
picture
object
into
the
class
module.
the
class
then
know
how
to
operate
on
the
picture
,
and
it
assumes
that
all
it
expected
piece
have
been
laid
out
appropriately.
this
approach
ha
several
downside
,
and
i
'd
like
something
a
bit
more
elegant
.
