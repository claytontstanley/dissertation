does
anyone
have
some
good
hint
for
writing
test
code
for
database-backend
development
where
there
is
a
heavy
dependency
on
state
?
specifically
,
i
want
to
write
test
for
code
that
retrieve
record
from
the
database
,
but
the
answer
will
depend
on
the
data
in
the
database
(
which
may
change
over
time
)
.
do
people
usually
make
a
separate
development
system
with
a
'frozen
'
database
so
that
any
given
function
should
always
return
the
exact
same
result
set
?
i
am
quite
sure
this
is
not
a
new
issue
,
so
i
would
be
very
interested
to
learn
from
other
people
's
experience
.
are
there
good
article
out
there
that
discus
this
issue
of
web-based
development
in
general
?
i
usually
write
php
code
,
but
i
would
expect
all
of
these
issue
are
largely
language
and
framework
agnostic
.
