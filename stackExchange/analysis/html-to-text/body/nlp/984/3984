i
've
created
some
mbunit
test
fixtures
that
have
setup
method
marked
with
the
setup
attribute.
these
method
run
before
the
test
just
fine
using
the
mbunit
gui
,
the
console
runner
,
and
the
resharper
mbunit
plugin.
however
,
when
i
run
the
test
with
testdriven.net
it
doe
not
run
the
setup
method
at
all.
does
anyone
know
if
this
is
a
bug
with
testdriven.net
or

i
have
something
setup
wrong
?
