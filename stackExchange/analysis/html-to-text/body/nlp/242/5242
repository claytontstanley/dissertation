although
i
'm
specifically
interested
in
web
application
information
,
i
would
also
be
somewhat
curious
about
desktop
application
development
a
well.
this
question
is
driven
by
my
work
on
my
personal
website
a
well
a
my
job
,
where
i
have
developed
a
few
feature
,
but
left
it
to
others
to
integrate
into
the
look
and
feel
of
the
site.
are
there
any
guide
or
rule
of
thumb
for
thing
like
color
scheme
,
layout
,
formatting
,
etc
?
i
want
to
ensure
readability
and
clarity
for
visitor
,
but
not
be
bland
and
dull
at
the
same
time.
as
for
my
knowledge
in
this
area
-
if
you
hand
me
a
picture
,
i
have
enough
knowledge
to
reproduce
it
on
the
screen
,
but
if
you
ask
me
to
design
a
new
interface
or
redesign
an
existing
one
,
i
would
n't
know
where
to
begin
.
