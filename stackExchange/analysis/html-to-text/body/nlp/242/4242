i
want
to
convert
a
primitive
to
a
string
,
and
i
tried
:
myint.tostring
(
)
;
this
fails
with
the
error
:
int
can
not
be
dereferenced
now
,
i
get
that
primitive
are
not
reference
type
(
ie
,
not
an
object
)
and
so
can
not
have
methods.
however
,
java
5
introduced
autoboxing
and
unboxing
(
a
la
c
#
...
which
i
never
liked
in
c
#
,
but
that
's
beside
the
point
)
.
so
with
autoboxing
,
i
would
expect
the
above
to
convert
myint
to
an
integer
and
then
call
tostring
(
)
on
that.
furthermore
,
i
believe
c
#
allows
such
a
call
,
unless
i
remember
incorrectly.
is
this
just
an
unfortunate
shortcoming
of
java
's
autoboxing/unboxing
specification
,
or
is
there
a
good
reason
for
this
?
