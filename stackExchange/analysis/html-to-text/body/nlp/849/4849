i
have
a
winforms
program
written
on
.net
2
which
host
a
webbrowser
control
and
render
asp.net
page
from
a
known
server.
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
drag
,
say
,
a
tree
node
from
a
treeview
in
my
winforms
app
into
a
specific
location
in
the
hosted
web
page
and
have
it
trigger
a
javascript
event
there.
currently
,
i
can
implement
the
idochostuihandler
interface
and
getting
drag\drop
event
on
the
browser
control
,
then
call
navigate
(
``
javascript
:
fire_event
(
...
)
''
)
on
the
control
to
execute
a
script
on
the
page.
however
,
i
want
this
to
work
only
when
i
drop
data
on
a
specific
part
of
the
page.
one
solution
,
i
suppose
,
would
be
to
bite
the
bullet
and
write
a
custom
browser
plugin
in
the
form
of
an
activex
control
,
embed
that
in
the
location
i
want
to
drop
to
and
let
that
implement
the
needed
drag\drop
interfaces.
would
that
work
?
is
there
a
cleaner
approach
?
can
i
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
browser
control
is
hosted
in
my
app
and
provide
some
further
level
of
interaction
?
