i
wa
watching
a
couple
of
episode
of
dnr.tv
and
wa
given
my
first
glimpse
of
resharper
,
i
wa
very
impressed
so
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
,
fully
aware
that
it
'd
take
some
getting
used
to
,
but
is
it
worth
depending
on
this
dependency
?
also
i
learn
best
by
following
tutorial
first
then
experimenting
,
is
there
a
good
tutorial
for
resharper
4
that
i
've
missed
on
my
googling
?
info
gathered
from
answer
so
far
i
'd
already
found
these
,
but
they
might
be
useful
for
others
useful

note
:
i
'm
pretty
sure
this
is
not
written
about
the
latest
version
of
resharper
,
so
i
ca
n't
be
sure
how
much
of
this
transfer
over
to
using
4.0
