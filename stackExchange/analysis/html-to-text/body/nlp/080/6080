we
are
in
the
early
design
stage
of
a
major
rewrite
of
our
product
.
right
now
our
customer
are
mostly
business
.
we
manage
account
.
user
name
for
an
account
are
each
on
their
own
namespace
but
it
mean
that
we
ca
n't
move
asset
between
server
.
we
want
to
move
to
a
single
namespace
.
but
that
brings
the
problem
of
unique
user
name
.
so
what
's
the
best
idea
?
email
address
(
w/verification
)
?
unique
alpha-numeric
string
(
``
johnsmith9234
''
)
?
should
we
look
at
openid
?
