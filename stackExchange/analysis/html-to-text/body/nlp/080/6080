we
are
in
the
early
design
stage
of
a
major
rewrite
of
our
product.
right
now
our
customer
are
mostly
businesses.
we
manage
accounts.
user
name
for
an
account
are
each
on
their
own
namespace
but
it
mean
that
we
ca
n't
move
asset
between
servers.
we
want
to
move
to
a
single
namespace.
but
that
brings
the
problem
of
unique
user
names.
so
what
's
the
best
idea
?
email
address
(
w/verification
)
?
unique
alpha-numeric
string
(
``
johnsmith9234
''
)
?
should
we
look
at
openid
?
