i
am
interested
in
learning
how
to
write
flash
program
,
but
i
'm
not
ready
to
shell
out
the
big
buck
for
flash
cs3
professional
.
what
's
the
best
compromise
between
affordability
and
education
?
edit
:
@
sparkes
:
given
that
this
is
for
personal
education
only
,
and
not
something
i
'm
likely
to
use
for
professional
purpose
anytime
soon
,
i
'm
very
unlikely
to
spend
the
$
400
on
the
full
version
of
cs3
.
i
'll
clarify
my
question
:
what
is
the
best
alternative
to
cs3
for
developing
flash
application
?
