linq
to
sql
allows
table
mapping
to
automatically
convert
back
and
forth
to
enums
by
specifying
the
type
for
the
column
-
this
work
for
string
or
integer
.
is
there
a
way
to
make
the
conversion
case
insensitive
or
add
a
custom
mapping
class
or
extenstion
method
into
the
mix
so
that
i
can
specify
what
the
string
should
look
like
in
more
detail
.
reasons
for
doing
so
might
be
in
order
to
supply
a
nicer
naming
convention
inside
some
new
funky
c
#
code
in
a
system
where
the
data
schema
is
already
set
(
and
is
being
relied
upon
by
some
legacy
apps
)
so
the
actual
text
in
the
database
ca
n't
be
changed
.
