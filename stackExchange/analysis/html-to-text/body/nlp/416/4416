i
am
walking
through
the
ms
press
windows
workflow
step-by-step
book
and
in
chapter
8
it
mention
a
tool
with
the
filename
``
wca.exe
''
.
this
is
supposed
to
be
able
to
generate
workflow
communication
helper
class
based
on
an
interface
you
provide
it.
i
ca
n't
find
that
file.
i
thought
it
would
be
in
the
latest
.net
3.5
sdk
,
but
i
just
downloaded
and
fully
installed
,
and
it
's
not
there.
also
,
some
msdn
forum
post
had
link
posted
that
just
go
to
404s.
so
,
where
can
i
find
wca.exe
?
