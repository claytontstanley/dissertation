are
there
any
favorite
online
reference
or
good
introductory
and
intermediate/advanced
book
on
this
topic
that
you
'd
recommend
?
the
backstory
is
that
i
'm
working
on
a
web
development
project
that
is
``
re-skinning
''
our
existing
web
site
to
make
it
more
usable
and
visually
appealing
given
current
technology
that
either
were
n't
available
or
widely
adopted
a
the
site
evolved
(
over
the
last
ten-plus
year
)
.
of
the
new
technology
and
method
,
css
,
although
not
really
all
that
new
,
is
the
most
interesting
to
me
because
it
is
clear
that
it
ha
great
power
beyond
simple
styling
of
font
and
color
-
and
,
a
the
saying
go
,
``
with
great
power
come
great
responsibility.
''
in
other
word
,
it
is
(
now
)
clear
to
me
that
css
is
more
than
a
way
to
apply
a
look
and
feel
to
page
markup
but
is
a
way
to
apply
behavior
to
web
pages.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
it
will
be
required
to
understand
at
a
fundamental
level
``
how
css
work
''
not
so
much
from
a
page
designer
's
perspective
but
from
that
of
a
programmer
or
software
engineer
in
order
to
find
and
correct
``
bug
''
in
the
behavior
of
a
given
web
page.
so
,
i
'm
looking
for
a
place
to
start
