i
'm
not
trying
to
start
controversy
,
but
i
'm
wanting
to
know
other
's
input
on
this
sometimes
touchy
subject
.
i
've
read
all
sort
of
material
about
how
you
can
find
competent
developer
in
india
(
and
now
sometimes
china
)
who
are
just
a
good
a
their
us
counterpart
,
but
at
largely
reduced
rate
.
specifically
i
recently
read
the
world
is
flat
and
he
seems
to
argue
in
favor
of
competent
,
cheap
offshore
development
.
from
my
personal
experience
working
with
offshore
developer
and
with
onshored
contractor
from
india
,
they
tend
to
be
not
very
competent
,
slow
to
learn
new
material
,
and
hard
to
work
with
due
to
cultural
barrier
.
obviously
this
is
a
bit
hand
wavy
,
but
that
truly
ha
been
my
experience
.
please
try
to
keep
response
above
board
and
well
thought
out
,
that
is
to
say
,
let
not
resort
to
broad
generalization
,
but
i
'd
like
to
know
what
your
thought
and
experience
on
the
subject
are
.
