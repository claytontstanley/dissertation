i
've
got
the
task
of
displaying
a
web
form
to
represent
the
property
in
a
.net
class
.
in
winforms
,
there
's
a
pre-fab
control
named
propertygrid
that
is
a
lot
like
what
i
need
.
i
'm
just
looking
for
something
to
display
a
simple
layout
of
property
name
next
to
an
appropriate
control
like
a
textbox
for
string
or
a
dropdownlist
for
enum
property
.
does
anything
like
this
already
exist
for
asp.net
,
or
will
i
be
rolling
my
own
here
?
thanks
