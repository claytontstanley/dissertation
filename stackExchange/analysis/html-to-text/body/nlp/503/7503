i
know
almost
nothing
about
linq
.
i
'm
doing
this
:
var
apps
=
from
app
in
process.getprocesses
(
)
where
app.processname.contains
(
``
myappname
''
)
&
&
app.mainwindowhandle
!
=
intptr.zero
select
app
;
which
get
me
all
the
running
process
which
match
that
criterion
.
but
i
do
n't
know
how
to
get
the
first
one
.
the
example
i
can
find
on
the
net
seem
to
imply
i
have
to
do
this
var
matchedapp
=
(
from
app
in
process.getprocesses
(
)
where
app.processname.contains
(
``
myappname
''
)
&
&
app.mainwindowhandle
!
=
intptr.zero
select
app
)
.first
(
)
;
which
strike
me
a
somewhat
ugly
,
and
also
throw
an
exception
if
there
are
no
matching
process
.
is
there
a
better
way
?
update
i
'm
actually
trying
to
find
the
first
matching
item
,
and
call
setforegroundwindow
on
it
i
've
come
up
with
this
solution
,
which
also
strike
me
a
ugly
and
awful
,
but
better
than
above
.
any
idea
?
var
unused
=
from
app
in
process.getprocesses
(
)
where
app.processname.contains
(
``
myappname
''
)
&
&
app.mainwindowhandle
!
=
intptr.zero
select
setforegroundwindow
(
app.mainwindowhandle
)
;
//
side-effects
in
linq-query
is
technically
bad
i
guess
