i
'm
writing
an
ajax
app
,
but
a
the
user
move
through
the
app
,
i
'd
like
the
url
in
the
address
bar
to
update
despite
the
lack
of
page
reloads.
basically
,
i
'd
like
for
them
to
be
able
to
bookmark
at
any
point
and
thereby
return
to
the
current
state.
how
are
people
handling
maintaining
restfulness
in
ajax
apps
?
thanks
in
advance
.
