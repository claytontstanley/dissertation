the
term
``
software
engineering
''
is
often
used
without
fully
being
considered.
since
the
field
is
relatively
young
compared
to
other
mature
professional
discipline
,
the
definition
is
arguably
still
be
worked
out
,
and
at
the
very
least
it
is
often
understood
differently
by
different
population
despite
being
``
defined
''
by
ieee
or
the
like.
so
,
how
's
software
engineering
being
defined
by
so
user
?
what
is
software
engineering
?
