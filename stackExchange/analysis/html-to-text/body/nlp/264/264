this
is
n't
a
question
,
just
more
seeking
expert
advice
.
what
's
the
optimal
level
of
concurrency
that
the
c++
implementation
of
berkeleydb
can
reasonably
support
?
how
many
thread
can
i
have
hammering
away
at
the
db
before
throughput
start
to
suffer
because
of
resource
contention
?
i
've
read
the
manual
and
know
how
to
set
the
number
of
lock
,
locker
,
database
page
size
,
etc.
,
but
i
'd
just
like
some
advice
from
someone
who
ha
real-world
experience
with
bdb
concurrency
.
my
application
is
pretty
simple
,
i
'll
be
doing
get
and
put
of
record
that
are
about
1kb
each
.
no
cursor
,
no
deleting
.
