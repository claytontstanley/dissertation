i
would
like
the
version
property
of
my
application
to
be
incremented
for
each
build
but
i
'm
not
sure
on
how
to
enable
this
functionality
in
visual
studio
(
2005/2008
)
.
i
have
tried
to
specify
the
assemblyversion
a
1.0
.
*
but
it
doe
n't
get
me
exactly
what
i
want
.
i
'm
also
using
a
setting
file
and
in
earlier
attempt
when
the
assembly
version
changed
my
setting
got
reset
to
the
default
since
the
application
looked
for
the
setting
file
in
another
directory
.
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
display
a
version
number
in
the
form
of
1.1.38
so
when
a
user
find
a
problem
i
can
log
the
version
they
are
using
a
well
a
tell
them
to
upgrade
if
they
have
an
old
release
.
a
short
explanation
of
how
the
versioning
work
would
also
be
appreciated
.
when
doe
the
build
and
revision
number
get
incremented
?
