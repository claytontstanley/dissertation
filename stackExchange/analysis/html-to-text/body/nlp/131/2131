pre-emptive
justification
:
you
need
to
fiddle
with
icon
when
programming
,
so
this
count
a
a
programming
question
,
right
?
do
you
know
of
any
good
freeware
application
that
can
browse
the
content
of
windows
icon
library
(
.icl
)
file
?
i
'm
not
interested
in
simple
extraction
.
i
'm
looking
for
explorer-like
browsing
within
library
and
good
display
of
different
icon
format
.
