back
in
the
old
day
,
help
wa
not
trivial
but
possible
:
generate
some
funky
.rtf
file
with
special
tag
,
run
it
through
a
compiler
,
and
you
got
a
winhelp
file
(
.hlp
)
that
actually
work
really
well.
then
,
microsoft
decided
that
winhelp
wa
not
hip
and
cool
anymore
and
switched
to
chm
,
up
to
the
point
they
actually
axed
winhelp
from
vista.
now
,
chm
maybe
nice
,
but
everyone
that
tried
to
open
a
.chm
file
on
the
network
will
know
the
nice
``
navigation
to
the
webpage
wa
canceled
''
screen
that
is
caused
by
security
restrictions.
while
there
are
way
to
make
chm
work
off
the
network
,
this
is
hardly
a
good
choice
,
because
when
a
user
press
the
help
button
he
want
help
and
not
have
to
make
some
funky
settings.
bottom
line
:
i
find
chm
absolutely
unusable.
but
with
winhelp
not
being
an
option
anymore
either
,
i
wonder
what
the
alternative
are
,
especially
when
it
come
to
integrate
with
my
application
(
i.e.
for
winhelp
and
chm
there
are
function
that
allow
you
to
directly
jump
to
a
topic
)
?
pdf
ha
the
disadvantage
of
requiring
the
adobe
reader
(
or
one
of
the
more
lightweight
one
that
not
many
people
use
)
.
i
could
live
with
that
seeing
a
this
is
kind
of
standard
nowadays
,
but
can
you
tell
it
reliably
to
jump
to
a
given
page/anchor
?
html
file
seem
to
be
the
best
choice
,
you
then
just
have
to
deal
with
different
browser
(
css
and
stuff
)
.
edit
:
thanks
so
far.
i
am
looking
to
create
my
own
help
files.
as
i
am
a
fan
of
the
``
no
setup
,
just
extract
and
run
''
philosophy
,
i
had
that
problem
many
time
in
the
past
because
many
of
my
user
will
run
it
off
the
network
,
which
cause
exactly
this
problem.
so
i
am
looking
for
a
more
robust
and
future-proof
way
to
provide
help
to
my
user
without
having
to
code
a
different
help
system
for
each
application
i
make.
chm
is
a
really
nice
format
,
but
that
security
stuff
make
it
unusable
,
a
a
help
system
is
supposed
to
provide
help
to
the
user
,
not
to
generate
even
more
problem
.
