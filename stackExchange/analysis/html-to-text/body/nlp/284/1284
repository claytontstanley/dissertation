i
am
looking
for
a
tool
that
can
detect
malicious
request
(
such
a
obvious
sql
injection
get
or
post
)
and
will
immediately
ban
the
ip
address
of
the
requester/add
to
a
blacklist.
i
know
,
i
know
,
the
code
should
be
able
to
handle
such
request
accordingly
but
there
is
still
value
in
such
a
tool
even
when
the
site
is
safe
from
such
attack
(
save
bandwidth
,
non
bloated
analytics
,
etc
)
firstly
i
would
be
looking
for
a
cross
platform
(
ie
lamp
and
.net
solution
that
sits
at
a
higher
level
than
the
technology
stack
,
perhaps
at
the
web
server
or
hardware
level
)
.
but
this
might
not
exist
and
perhaps
there
are
only
technology
specific
solutions.
s
id
like
to
hear
your
thought
.
