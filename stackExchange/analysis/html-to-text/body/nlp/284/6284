i
've
only
been
using
vs
2008
team
foundation
for
a
few
week
.
over
the
last
few
day
,
i
've
noticed
that
sometimes
one
of
my
objects/controls
on
my
page
just
disappears
from
intellisense
.
the
project
build
perfectly
and
the
object
are
still
in
the
html
,
but
i
still
ca
n't
find
the
object
.
any
one
else
notice
this
?
edit
:
for
what
it
's
worth
,
i
know
if
i
close
vs
and
then
open
it
up
again
,
it
come
back
.
