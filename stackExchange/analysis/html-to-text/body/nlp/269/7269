i
'm
part
of
a
team
that
develops
a
pretty
big
swing
java
applet.
most
of
our
code
is
legacy
and
there
are
ton
of
singleton
references.
we
've
bunched
all
of
them
to
a
single
``
application
context
''
singleton.
what
we
now
need
is
to
create
some
way
to
separate
the
shared
context
(
shared
across
all
applet
currently
showing
)
and
non-shared
context
(
specific
to
each
applet
currently
showing
)
.
however
,
we
do
n't
have
an
id
at
each
of
the
location
that
call
to
the
singleton
,
nor
do
we
want
to
propagate
the
id
to
all
locations.
what
's
the
easiest
way
to
identify
in
which
applet
context
we
're
running
?
(
i
've
tried
messing
with
classloaders
,
thread
group
,
thread
id
...
so
far
i
could
find
nothing
that
will
enabled
me
to
id
the
origin
of
the
call
)
.
