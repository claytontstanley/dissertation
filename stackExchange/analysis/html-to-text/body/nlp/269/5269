what
order
doe
the
runtime
evaluate
a
logic
statement
?
example
:
datatable
mydt
=
new
datatable
(
)
;
if
(
mydt
!
=
null
&
&
mydt.rows.count
>
0
)
{
//do
some
stuff
with
mydt
}
which
statement
doe
the
runtime
evaluate
first
-
mydt
!
=
null
or
:
mydt.rows.count
>
0
?
is
there
a
time
when
the
compiler
would
ever
evaluate
the
statement
backwards
?
perhaps
when
an
``
or
''
operator
is
involved
?
