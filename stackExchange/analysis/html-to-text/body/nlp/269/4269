what
is
the
best
way
to
programmatically
send
an
sms
text
message
?
are
there
any
free
web
service
based
sms
gateway
?
i
know
that
if
i
happen
to
know
the
user
's
carrier
(
sprint
,
at
&
t
,
etc
)
,
i
can
send
an
sms
by
emailing
an
address
based
on
phone
number
+
carrier
.
i
would
like
a
good
solution
that
doe
not
require
me
to
know
the
carrier
.
barring
that
,
is
there
an
easy
way
to
lookup
carrier
given
a
cell
phone
number
?
i
understand
that
there
are
some
service
independent
of
the
major
mobile
carrier
that
offer
a
per-message
fee-based
service
,
with
api
.
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
how
such
organization
tap
into
the
sms
network
.
do
they
have
contract
with
mobile
carrier
to
resell
their
service
?
