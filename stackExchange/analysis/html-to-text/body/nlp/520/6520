i
've
recently
been
leaning
towards
the
apress
book
for
my
learning
need
,
though
in
the
past
i
've
used
wrox
,
sams
and
o'reilly
amongst
others
.
i
know
this
might
just
be
personal
preference
but
are
certain
publisher
more/less
stringent
on
quality
?
do
boks
from
certain
publisher
have
a
certain
'feel
'
?
just
curious
a
i
'm
a
student
so
buying
a
Â£30
book
is
still
a
stop
and
think
event
.
