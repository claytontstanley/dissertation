i
have
come
across
a
lot
of
optimization
tip
which
say
that
you
should
mark
your
class
a
sealed
to
get
extra
performance
benefit
.
i
ran
some
test
to
check
the
performance
differential
and
found
none
.
am
i
doing
something
wrong
?
am
i
missing
the
case
where
sealed
class
will
give
better
result
?
has
anyone
run
test
and
seen
a
difference
?
help
me
learn
