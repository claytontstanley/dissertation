i
have
and
pretty
standard
table
setup
in
a
current
application
using
the
.net
xsd
dataset
and
tableadapter
feature
.
my
contract
table
consists
of
some
standard
contract
information
,
with
a
column
for
the
primary
department
.
this
column
is
a
foreign
key
to
my
departments
table
,
where
i
store
the
basic
department
name
,
id
,
note
.
this
is
all
setup
and
functioning
in
my
sql
server
.
when
i
use
the
xsd
tool
,
i
can
drag
both
table
in
at
once
and
it
auto
detects/creates
the
foreign
key
i
have
between
these
two
table
.
this
work
great
when
i
'm
on
my
main
page
and
am
viewing
contract
data
.
however
,
when
i
go
to
my
administrative
page
to
modify
the
department
data
.
i
typically
do
something
like
this
:
dim
dtdepartment
as
new
departmentdatatable
(
)
dim
tadepartment
as
new
departmenttableadapter
(
)
tadepartment.fill
(
dtdepartment
)
however
,
at
this
point
an
exception
is
thrown
saying
to
the
effect
that
there
is
a
foreign
key
reference
broken
here
,
i
'm
guessing
since
i
do
n't
have
the
contract
datatable
filled
.
has
anybody
encountered
this
before
?
i
know
i
can
simply
remove
the
foreign
key
from
the
xsd
to
make
thing
work
fine
,
but
having
the
additional
integrity
check
there
and
having
the
xsd
schema
match
the
sql
schema
in
the
database
is
nice
.
