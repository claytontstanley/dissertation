what
is
the
best
approach
to
write
hook
for
subversion
in
windows
?
as
far
a
i
know
,
only
executable
file
can
be
used
.
so
what
is
the
best
choice
?
plain
batch
file
(
very
limited
but
perhaps
ok
for
very
simple
solution
)
dedicated
compiled
executable
application
(
sledgehammer
to
crack
a
nutshell
?
)
some
other
hybrid
choice
(
like
a
batch
file
running
a
powershell
script
)
