can
anyone
recommend
software
or
a
.net
library
that
will
check
for
bounced
email
and
the
reason
for
the
bounce
?
i
get
bounced
email
into
a
pop3
account
that
i
can
read
then
.
i
need
it
to
keep
my
user
database
clean
from
invalid
email
address
and
want
to
automate
this
(
mark
user
a
invalid
email
)
.
