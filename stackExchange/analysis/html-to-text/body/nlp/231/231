how
do
i
make
it
so
mailto
:
link
will
be
registered
with
my
program
?
and
then
how
would
i
handle
that
event
in
my
program
?
most
of
the
solution
i
found
from
a
quick
google
search
are
how
to
do
this
manually
,
but
i
need
to
do
this
automatically
for
user
of
my
program
if
they
click
a
button
such
a
``
set
a
default
email
client
''
.
edit
:
removed
reference
to
delphi
,
because
the
answer
is
independent
of
your
language
.
