jeff
atwood
is
often
expounding
the
benefit
of
triple
monitor
setup
for
developer
,
and
i
have
to
say
i
agree
with
him
.
however
,
we
are
about
to
take
on
a
good
number
of
new
developer
and
are
hoping
to
kit
them
out
with
a
nice
development
environment
.
i
wa
wondering
,
if
given
the
opportunity
,
what
you
people
would
think
of
a
the
perfect
setup
-
one
,
two
,
three
,
or
perhaps
even
four
monitor
!
try
not
to
think
about
what
you
would
like
to
have
in
order
to
show
off
(
or
play
warcraft
on
!
)
but
rather
,
what
do
you
think
would
offer
the
peak
performance
increase
for
your
development
activity
.
