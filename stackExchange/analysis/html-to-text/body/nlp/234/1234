hi
guy
!
as
anyone
ever
assisted
the
csla
master
class
from
rockford
lhotka
?
(
www
)
.
it
seems
a
good
way
to
enforce
my
oo
knowledge
in
the
asp.net
field
,
but
since
i
have
to
consider
the
flight
to
atlanta
and
the
course
's
price
(
$
2.500
)
,
i
'm
not
convinced
yet.
also
,
i
could
barrely
find
any
feedback
on
the
web.
could
anyone
share
some
experience
or
comment
?
thanks
a
lot
.
