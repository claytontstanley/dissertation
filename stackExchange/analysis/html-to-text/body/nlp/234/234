mysql
ha
this
incredibly
useful
yet
properitary
replace
into
sql
command
.
i
wonder
:
can
this
easily
be
emulated
in
sql
server
2005
?
starting
a
new
transaction
,
doing
a
select
(
)
and
then
either
update
or
insert
and
commit
is
always
a
little
bit
a
pain
in
the
a..
,
especially
when
doing
it
in
the
application
and
therefore
always
keeping
2
version
of
the
statement
.
i
wonder
if
there
is
an
easy
and
universal
way
to
implement
such
a
function
into
sql
server
2005
?
