so
my
company
store
alot
of
data
in
a
foxpro
database
and
trying
to
get
around
the
performance
hit
of
touching
it
directly
i
wa
thinking
of
messaging
anything
that
can
be
done
asynchronously
for
a
snappier
user
experience
.
i
started
looking
at
activemq
but
do
n't
know
how
well
c
#
will
hook
with
it
.
wanting
to
hear
what
all
of
you
guy
think
.
edit
:
it
is
going
to
be
a
web
application
.
anything
touching
this
foxpro
is
kinda
slow
(
probably
because
the
person
who
set
it
up
10
year
ago
messed
it
all
to
hell
,
some
of
the
table
file
are
incredibly
large
)
.
we
replicate
the
foxpro
to
sql
nightly
and
most
of
our
data
read
are
ok
being
a
day
old
so
we
are
focusing
on
the
writes
.
plus
the
write
affect
a
critical
part
of
the
user
experience
(
purchasing
)
,
we
store
it
in
sql
and
then
just
message
to
have
it
put
into
foxpro
when
it
can
.
i
wish
we
could
just
get
rid
of
the
foxpro
,
unfortunately
the
company
doe
n't
want
to
get
rid
of
a
very
old
piece
of
software
they
bought
that
depends
on
it
.
