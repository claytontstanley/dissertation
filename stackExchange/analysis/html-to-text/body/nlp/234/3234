how
would
one
display
any
add
content
from
a
``
dynamic
''
aspx
page
?
currently
i
am
working
on
using
the
system.web.httpresponse
``
page.response
''
to
write
a
file
that
is
stored
on
a
web
server
to
a
web
request.
this
would
allow
people
to
hit
a
url
to
the
type
http
:
//www.foo.com
?
image=test.jpg
and
have
the
image
display
in
their
browser.
so
a
you
may
know
this
revolves
around
the
use
of
response.contenttype.
by
using
response.contenttype
=
``
application/octet-stream
''
;
i
am
able
to
display
image
of
type
gif/jpeg/png
(
all
i
have
tested
so
far
)
,
bit
trying
to
display
.swf
or
.ico
file
give
me
a
nice
little
error.
using
response.contenttype
=
``
application/x-shockwave-flash
''
;
i
can
get
flash
file
to
play
,
but
then
the
image
are
messed.
so
how
do
i
easily
choose
the
contenttype
?
