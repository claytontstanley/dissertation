i
have
a
web
reference
for
our
report
server
embedded
in
our
application
.
the
server
that
the
report
live
on
could
change
though
,
and
i
'd
like
to
be
able
to
change
it
``
on
the
fly
''
if
necessary
.
i
know
i
've
done
this
before
,
but
ca
n't
seem
to
remember
how
.
thanks
for
your
help
.
update
-
i
've
manually
driven
around
this
for
the
time
being
.
it
's
not
a
big
deal
to
set
the
url
in
the
code
,
but
i
'd
like
to
figure
out
what
the
``
proper
''
way
of
doing
this
in
vs
2008
is
.
could
anyone
provide
any
further
insight
?
thanks
!
