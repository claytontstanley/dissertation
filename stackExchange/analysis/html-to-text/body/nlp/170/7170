although
i
have
quite
a
few
year
of
experience
of
building
web
application
in
java
,
i
've
not
really
done
much
web
development
in
the
more
lightweight
'lamp
'
style.
i
've
recently
picked
up
python
and
am
quite
liking
what
i
see
so
far
,
but
there
is
n't
an
'obvious
'
choice
for
which
web
framework
to
use
,
a
it
seems
there
are
a
number
of
well-used
options.
while
i
'd
like
to
have
a
nice
rich
framework
to
use
,
i
would
prefer
a
framework
that
wa
accessible
rather
than
one
that
``
did
a
lot
of
code
for
me
''
.
mainly
because
if
i
then
need
to
customise
something
,
i
need
to
get
involved
in
a
lot
of
that
boilerplate
code.
so
given
this
thinking
,
what
would
be
the
best
option
for
python
web
development
?
