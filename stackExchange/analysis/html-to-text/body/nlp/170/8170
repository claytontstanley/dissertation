i
'm
trying
to
find
a
well
written
understandable
tutorial
for
beginner
trying
to
use
the
window
command
prompt.
i
'm
working
with
one
such
beginner
and
they
keep
calling
me
with
question
about
command
,
and
i
want
a
concise
tutorial
or
reference
to
send
them
to.
i
tried
google
,
with
many
combination
of
the
likely
search
term
,
and
got
nothing
but
garbage.
there
's
a
lot
of
document
out
there
,
but
none
of
them
are
what
i
'd
call
good.
does
anyone
happen
to
know
of
a
great
tutorial
for
how
to
use
the
window
command
prompt
?
(
this
is
the
best
i
found
so
far
,
but
the
page
style
is
horrible
--
you
have
to
turn
off
the
stylesheet
in
your
browser
for
this
one.
)
thanks
to
brad
for
the
distinction
between
dos
and
windows
commmand
line
,
duly
noted.
to
those
offering
up
command
reference
,
thank
you.
what
i
really
need
is
more
of
a
tutorial
than
a
reference
:
the
beginner
probably
doe
n't
know
what
command
he
is
looking
for
,
so
the
reference
is
le
useful
