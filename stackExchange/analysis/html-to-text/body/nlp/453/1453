i
'm
trying
to
do
this
(
which
produce
an
unexpected
t_variable
error
)
:
public
function
createshipment
(
$
startzip
,
$
endzip
,
$
weight
=
$
this-
>
getdefaultweight
(
)
)
{
}
i
do
n't
want
to
put
a
magic
number
in
there
for
weight
,
since
the
object
i
am
using
ha
a
``
defaultweight
''
parameter
that
all
new
shipment
get
if
you
do
n't
specify
a
weight.
i
ca
n't
put
the
defaultweight
in
the
shipment
itself
,
because
it
change
from
shipment
group
to
shipment
group.
is
there
a
better
way
to
do
it
than
the
following
?
public
function
createshipment
(
$
startzip
,
$
endzip
,
weight
=
0
)
{
if
(
$
weight
<
=
0
)
{
$
weight
=
$
this-
>
getdefaultweight
(
)
;
}
}
