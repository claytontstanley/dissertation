what
is
the
concensus
on
when
to
use
one
of
these
tool
adversed
to
the
other
?
i
find
subsonic
very
useful
in
term
of
getting
thing
done
quickly
,
but
on
large
project
it
tends
not
to
scale
,
and
it
tie
your
domain
model
to
your
database
model.
that
is
where
nhibernate
come
in
a
it
give
you
lightweight
pocos
that
are
unrelated
to
your
database
model
,
but
the
setup
time
is
much
longer
.
