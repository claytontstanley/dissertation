i
have
a
simple
setter
method
for
a
java
property
and
null
is
not
appropriate
for
this
particular
property.
i
have
always
been
torn
,
in
this
situation
:
should
i
throw
an
illegalargumentexception
,
or
a
nullpointerexception
?
from
the
javadocs
,
both
seem
appropriate.
is
there
some
kind
of
understood
standard
?
or
is
this
just
one
of
those
thing
that
you
should
do
whatever
you
prefer
and
both
is
really
correct
?
