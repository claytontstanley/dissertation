i
have
a
fairly
simple
asp.net
2.0
menu
control
using
a
sitemap
file
and
security
trimmings.
there
are
only
21
menu
option
,
but
the
result
html
of
the
menu
is
a
whopping
14k.
the
site
is
hosted
on
our
company
's
intranet
and
must
be
serverd
to
people
worldwide
on
limited
bandwidth
,
so
i
'd
like
to
reduce
the
size
of
the
menus.
what
is
the
best
way
to
do
this
?
does
anybody
have
a
good
reference
?
i
have
the
following
constraint
:
the
solution
can
not
reference
any
3rd
part
dll
file
(
getting
approval
would
be
a
nightmare
)
must
work
with
ie
6
css
and
javascript
are
fine
,
a
long
a
they
work
with
ie
6
.
