when
developing
a
new
web
based
application
which
version
of
html
should
you
aim
for
?
edit
:
cool
i
wa
just
attempting
to
get
a
feel
from
others
i
tend
to
use
xhtml
1.0
strict
in
my
own
work
and
transitional
when
others
are
involved
in
the
content
creation.
i
marked
the
first
xhtml
1.0
transitional
post
a
the
'correct
answer
'
but
believe
strongly
that
all
the
answer
given
at
that
point
where
equally
valid
.
