i
'm
importing
some
data
from
a
csv
file
,
and
number
that
are
larger
1000
get
turned
into
``
1,100
''
etc.
what
's
a
good
way
to
remove
both
the
quote
and
the
comma
from
this
so
i
can
put
it
into
an
int
field
?
edit
:
the
data
is
actually
already
in
a
mysql
table
,
so
i
need
to
be
able
to
this
using
sql.
sorry
for
the
mixup
.
