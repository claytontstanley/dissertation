i
am
working
on
a
collection
of
class
used
for
video
playback
and
recording
.
i
have
one
main
class
which
act
like
the
public
interface
,
with
method
like
play
(
)
,
stop
(
)
,
pause
(
)
,
record
(
)
...
etc
.
then
i
have
workhorse
class
which
do
the
video
decoding
and
video
encoding
.
i
just
learned
about
the
existence
of
nested
class
in
c++
,
and
i
'm
curious
to
know
what
programmer
think
about
using
them
.
i
'm
a
little
wary
and
not
really
sure
what
the
benefits/drawbacks
are
,
but
they
seem
(
according
to
the
book
i
'm
reading
)
to
be
used
in
case
such
a
mine
.
the
book
suggests
that
in
a
scenario
like
mine
,
a
good
solution
would
be
to
nest
the
workhorse
class
inside
the
interface
class
,
so
there
are
no
separate
file
for
class
the
client
is
not
meant
to
use
,
and
to
avoid
any
possible
naming
conflict
?
i
do
n't
know
about
these
justification
.
nested
class
are
a
new
concept
to
me
.
just
want
to
see
what
programmer
think
about
the
issue
.
