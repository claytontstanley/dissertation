ultramon
is
a
great
program
for
dual
monitor
(
stretching
screen
across
monitor
)
,
but
i
wa
wondering
if
there
is
any
way
do
to
something
in
visual
studio
like
have
one
tab
of
code
open
on
one
monitor
and
a
second
tab
of
code
open
on
the
second
monitor
with
only
one
instance
of
visual
studio
running
?
or
are
there
any
other
suggestion
on
getting
most
bang
for
buck
on
dual
monitor
and
visual
studio
?
