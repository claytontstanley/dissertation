when
using
ie
,
you
can
not
put
an
absolutely
positioned
div
over
a
select
input
element.
that
's
because
the
select
element
is
considered
an
activex
object
and
is
on
top
of
every
html
element
in
the
page.
i
already
saw
people
hiding
selects
when
opening
a
popup
div
,
that
lead
to
pretty
bad
user
experience
having
control
disappearing.
fogbugz
actually
had
a
pretty
smart
solution
(
before
v6
)
of
turning
every
select
into
text
box
when
a
popup
wa
displayed.
this
solved
the
bug
and
tricked
the
user
eye
but
the
behavior
wa
not
perfect.
another
solution
is
in
fogbugz
6
where
they
no
more
use
the
select
element
and
recoded
it
everywhere.
last
solution
i
currently
use
is
messing
up
the
ie
rendering
engine
and
force
it
to
render
the
absolutely
positioned
div
a
an
activex
element
too
,
ensuring
it
can
live
over
a
select
element.
this
is
achieved
by
placing
an
invisible
iframe
inside
the
div
and
styling
it
with
:
#
mydiv
iframe
{
position
:
absolute
;
z-index
:
-1
;
filter
:
mask
(
)
;
border
:
0
;
margin
:
0
;
padding
:
0
;
top
:
0
;
left
:
0
;
width
:
9999px
;
height
:
9999px
;
overflow
:
hidden
;
}
anyone
ha
a
even
better
solution
than
this
one
?
edit
:
the
purpose
of
this
question
is
a
much
informative
a
it
is
a
real
question.
i
find
the
iframe
trick
to
be
a
good
solution
but
i
am
still
looking
for
improvement
like
removing
this
ugly
useless
iframe
tag
that
degrade
accessibility
.
