i
'm
about
to
build
a
piece
of
a
project
that
will
need
to
build
and
post
an
xml
document
to
a
web
service
,
and
i
'd
like
to
do
it
in
python
a
a
mean
to
expand
my
skill
there
.
unfortunately
,
while
i
know
the
xml
model
fairly
well
in
.net
,
i
'm
uncertain
what
the
pro
and
con
are
of
the
xml
model
in
python
.
anyone
have
experience
doing
xml
processing
in
python
?
where
would
you
suggest
i
start
.
the
xml
file
i
'll
be
building
will
be
fairly
simple
.
