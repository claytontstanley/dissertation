i
'm
currently
working
on
an
application
with
a
frontend
written
in
adobe
flex
3.
i
'm
aware
of
flexunit
but
what
i
'd
really
like
is
a
unit
test
runner
for
ant/nant
and
a
runner
that
integrates
with
the
flex
builder
ide
(
aka
eclipse
)
.
does
one
exist
?
also
,
are
there
any
other
resource
on
how
to
do
flex
development
``
the
right
way
''
besides
the
cairngorm
microarchitecture
example
?
edit
:
thanks
for
the
great
replies.
unfortunately
so
will
only
let
me
accept
one
answer
,
so
due
to
reason
of
not
having
tried
either
approach
yet
,
i
decided
to
accept
the
one
that
came
first.
upmods
for
both
,
though.
