is
anyone
successfully
using
the
latest
64-bit
ganymede
release
of
eclipse
on
windows
xp
or
vista
64-bit
?
currently
i
run
the
normal
eclipse
3.4
distribution
on
a
32bit
jdk
and
launch
&
compile
my
apps
with
a
64bit
jdk
.
our
previous
experience
ha
been
that
the
64bit
eclipse
distro
is
unstable
for
u
,
so
i
'm
curious
if
anyone
is
using
it
successfully
.
we
are
using
jdk
1.6.0_05
.
