getting
back
into
a
bit
more
.net
after
a
few-years
of
not
using
it
full-time
,
and
wondering
what
the
good
unit
testing
package
are
these
day
.
i
'm
familiar
with
nunit
(
a
few
year
ago
)
,
and
have
played
briefly
around
with
ironruby
,
with
the
goal
of
getting
something
like
rspec
going
,
but
do
n't
know
much
beyond
that
.
i
realise
i
could
google
for
this
and
call
it
a
day
but
i
believe
i
'm
likely
to
get
a
better
and
more
informed
response
from
asking
a
question
here
:

suggestions
