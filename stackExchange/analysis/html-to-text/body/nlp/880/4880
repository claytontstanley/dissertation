my
organization
ha
a
form
to
allow
user
to
update
their
email
address
with
us.
it
's
suggested
that
we
have
two
input
box
for
email
:
the
second
a
an
email
confirmation.
i
always
copy/paste
my
email
address
when
faced
with
the
confirmation.
i
'm
assuming
most
of
our
user
are
not
so
savvy.
regardless
,
is
this
considered
a
good
practice
?
i
ca
n't
stand
it
personally
,
but
i
also
realize
it
probably
is
n't
meant
for
me.
if
someone
screw
up
their
email
,
they
ca
n't
login
,
and
they
must
call
to
sort
thing
out
.
