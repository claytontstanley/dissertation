i
'm
pretty
new
to
my
company
(
2
week
)
and
we
're
starting
a
new
platform
for
our
system
using
.net
3.5
team
foundation
from
dotnetnuke
.
our
``
architect
''
is
suggesting
we
use
one
class
project
.
of
course
,
i
chime
back
with
a
``
3-tier
''
architecture
(
business
,
data
,
web
class
project
)
.
is
there
any
disadvantage
to
using
this
architecture
?
pro
's
would
be
separation
of
code
from
data
,
keeping
class
object
away
from
your
code
,
etc
.
