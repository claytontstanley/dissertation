a
researcher
ha
created
a
small
simulation
in
matlab
,
and
we
want
to
make
it
accessible
to
others
.
my
plan
is
to
take
the
simulation
,
clean
up
a
few
thing
,
and
turn
it
into
a
set
of
function
.
then
,
i
plan
to
compile
it
into
a
c
library
and
use
swig
to
create
a
python
wrapper
.
at
that
point
,
i
should
be
able
to
call
the
simulation
from
a
small
django
app
.
at
least
,
i
hope
so
.
do
i
have
the
right
plan
?
has
anyone
else
done
something
similar
?
can
you
let
me
know
if
there
are
some
serious
pitfall
i
'm
not
aware
of
at
the
moment
?
