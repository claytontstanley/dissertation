i
'm
starting
work
on
a
hobby
project
with
a
python
codebase
and
would
like
to
set
up
some
form
of
continuous
integration
(
i.e
.
running
a
battery
of
test-cases
each
time
a
check-in
is
made
and
sending
nag
e-mail
to
responsible
person
when
the
test
fail
)
similar
to
cruisecontrol
or
teamcity
.
i
realize
i
could
do
this
with
hook
in
most
vcses
,
but
that
requires
that
the
test
run
on
the
same
machine
a
the
version
control
server
,
which
is
n't
a
elegant
a
i
would
like
.
does
anyone
have
any
suggestion
for
a
small
,
user-friendly
,
open-source
continuous
integration
system
suitable
for
a
python
codebase
?
