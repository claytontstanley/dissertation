something
i
've
run
into
posting
on
so
:
when
you
refer
to
a
function
with
argument
,
what
is
the
best
way
to
typeset
it
for
readibility
,
brevity
,
and
accuracy
?
i
tend
to
put
empty
parenthesis
after
the
function
name
like
func
(
)
,
even
if
there
are
actually
argument
for
the
function
.
i
have
trouble
including
the
argument
and
still
feeling
like
the
paragraph
is
readable
.
any
thought
on
best
practice
for
this
?
