the
discussion
of
dual
vs.
quadcore
is
a
old
a
the
quadcores
itself
and
the
answer
is
usually
``
it
depends
on
your
scenario
''
.
so
here
the
scenario
is
a
web
server
(
windows
2003
(
not
sure
if
x32
or
x64
)
,
4
gb
ram
,
iis
,
asp.net
3.0
)
.
my
impression
is
that
the
cpu
in
a
webserver
doe
not
need
to
be
that
fast
because
request
are
usually
rather
lightweight
,
so
having
more
(
slower
)
core
should
be
a
better
choice
a
we
got
many
small
request
.
but
since
i
do
not
have
much
experience
with
iis
load
balancing
and
since
i
do
n't
want
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
only
to
find
out
i
've
made
the
wrong
choice
,
can
someone
who
ha
a
bit
more
experience
comment
on
whether
or
not
more
slower
or
fewer
faster
core
is
better
?
