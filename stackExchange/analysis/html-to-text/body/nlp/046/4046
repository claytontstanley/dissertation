i
'm
trying
to
convince
my
provider
to
use
ant
instead
of
rational
application
development
so
anyone
can
recompile
,
recheck
,
redeploy
the
solution
anyplace
,
anytime
,
anyhow.
:
p
i
started
a
build.xml
for
a
project
that
generates
a
jar
file
but
stopped
there
and
i
need
real
example
to
compare
notes.
my
good
friend
!
i
do
n't
have
anyone
close
to
chat
about
this
!
this
is
my
build.xml
so
far.

i
edited
my
question
based
in
the
suggestion
of
to
use
pastebin.ca
