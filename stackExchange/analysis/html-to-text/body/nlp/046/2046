as
a
novice
in
practicing
test-driven
development
,
i
often
end
up
on
a
quandary
a
to
how
to
unit
test
persistence
to
a
database
.
i
know
that
technically
this
would
technically
be
an
integration
test
(
not
a
unit
test
)
,
but
i
want
to
find
out
the
best
strategy
for
the
ff
:
testing
query
.
testing
insert
.
how
do
i
know
that
it
is
the
insert
that
ha
gone
wrong
if
it
fails
?
i
may
test
it
by
inserting
and
then
querying
--
how
do
i
know
that
it
is
n't
the
querying
that
went
wrong
?
testing
update
and
deletes
--
same
a
testing
insert
what
are
the
best
practice
doing
these
?
