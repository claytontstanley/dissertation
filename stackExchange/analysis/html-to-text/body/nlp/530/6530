i
have
a
asp.net
application
that
we
've
written
our
own
logging
module
for.
my
question
is
,
where
is
the
standard
place
to
write
a
log
file
to
?
i.e.
the
website
will
be
running
a
the
anonymous
user
identity
(
e.g.
iusr
on
iis7
)
and
i
need
a
place
where
i
know
it
'll
have
permission
to
write
to.
cheers,
