hi
,
i
have
a
route
that
i
am
calling
through
a
redirecttoroute
like
this
:
return
this.redirecttoroute
(
``
super-superroute
''
,
new
{
year
=
selectedyear
}
)
;
i
have
also
tried
:
return
this.redirecttoroute
(
``
super-superroute
''
,
new
{
controller
=
``
super
''
,
action
=
``
superroute
''
,
id
=
``
routetopic
''
,
year
=
selectedyear
}
)
;
the
route
in
the
global.asax
is
like
this
:
routes.maproute
(
''
super-superroute
''
,
//
route
name
''
super.mvc/superroute/
{
year
}
''
,
//
url
with
parameter
new
{
controller
=
``
super
''
,
action
=
``
superroute
''
,
id
=
``
routetopic
''
}
//
parameter
default
)
;
so
why
do
i
get
the
error
:
``
no
route
in
the
route
table
match
the
supplied
values.
''
?
thanks
to
ricky
for
putting
me
on
the
right
track
.
i
saw
that
the
type
of
selectedyear
wa
var
.
when
i
tried
to
convert
to
int
with
int.parse
i
realised
that
selectedyear
wa
actually
null
,
which
would
explain
the
problem
.
i
guess
next
time
i
'll
pay
more
attention
to
the
value
of
the
variable
at
a
breakpoint
