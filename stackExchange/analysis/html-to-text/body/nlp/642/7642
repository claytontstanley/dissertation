is
there
an
official
convention
for
naming
private
field
in
vb.net
?
for
example
,
if
i
have
a
property
called
'foo
'
,
i
normally
call
the
private
field
'_foo
'
.
this
seems
to
be
frowned
upon
in
the
offical
guidelines
:
''
do
not
use
a
prefix
for
field
name
.
for
example
,
do
not
use
g_
or
s_
to
distinguish
static
versus
non-static
field
.
``
in
c
#
,
you
could
call
the
private
field
'foo
'
,
the
property
'foo
'
,
and
refer
to
the
private
field
a
'this.foo
'
in
the
constructor
.
as
vb.net
is
case
insensitive
you
ca
n't
do
this
-
any
suggestion
?
