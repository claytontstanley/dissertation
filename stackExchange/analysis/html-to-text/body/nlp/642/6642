i
wa
trying
to
add
a
favicon
to
a
website
earlier
and
looked
for
a
better
way
to
implement
this
than
to
dump
a
favicon.ico
file
in
the
root
of
the
website
.
i
found
this
nice
little
guide
:
how
to
add
a
favicon
.
however
,
the
preferred
method
did
not
work
in
ie
(
7
)
and
the
second
method
is
the
old
fashioned
way
(
which
i
resigned
myself
to
use
)
.
is
there
a
third
method
that
work
across
all
the
most
popular
browser
?
