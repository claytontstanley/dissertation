i
need
help
finishing
my
custom
built
ajax
[
div
]
based
dynamic
dropdown.
basically
,
i
have
an
[
input
]
box
which
;
onkeyup
,
run
an
ajax
search
which
return
a
bunch
of
result
in
divs
and
are
drawn
back
in
using
innerhtml.
these
divs
all
have
highlight
onmouseover
so
,
a
typical
successfull
search
yield
the
following
structure
(
pardon
the
semicode
)
:
[
input
]
[
div
id=results
]
//this
get
overwritten
contantly
by
my
ajax
function
[
div
id=result1
onmouseover=highlight
onclick=input.value=result1
]
[
div
id=result2
onmouseover=highlight
onclick=input.value=result2
]
[
div
id=result2
onmouseover=highlight
onclick=input.value=result2
]
[
/div
]
it
works..
beautifully
!
look
elegant
and
is
way
more
complete
than
any
regular
dropdown
(
those
result
div
bring
in
a
lot
of
information
)
.
however
,
i
'm
missing
the
most
of
important
function
behind
regular
html
element
,
that
is
,
i
ca
n't
keyboard
down
or
up
between
``
option
''
.
how
do
i
do
this
?
i
know
javascript
handle
keyboard
event
but
;
i
have
n't
been
able
to
find
a
good
guide
on
how
to
do
this.
(
of
course
the
follow
up
question
to
this
will
eventually
end
up
being
:
``
can
i
use
to
trigger
that
onclick
event
)
phew
!
cheers
