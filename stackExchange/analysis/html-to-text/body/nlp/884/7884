i
've
just
come
across
this
in
a
where
clause
:
and
not
(
t.id
=
@
id
)
how
doe
this
compare
with
:
and
t.id
!
=
@
id
or
with
:
and
t.id
<
>
@
id
i
'd
always
write
the
latter
myself
,
but
clearly
someone
else
think
differently
.
is
one
going
to
perform
any
better
than
the
other
?
i
know
that
using
<
>
or
!
=
is
going
to
bust
any
hope
for
using
an
index
that
i
might
have
had
,
but
surely
the
first
approach
above
will
suffer
the
same
problem
?
