i
wonder
how
you
guy
manage
deployment
of
a
database
between
2
sql
servers
,
specifically
sql
server
2005.
now
,
there
is
a
development
and
a
live
one.
as
this
should
be
part
of
a
buildscript
(
standard
window
batch
,
even
do
with
current
complexity
of
those
script
,
i
might
switch
to
powershell
or
so
later
)
,
enterprise
manager/management
studio
express
do
not
count.
would
you
just
copy
the
.mdf
file
and
attach
it
?
i
am
always
a
bit
careful
when
working
with
binary
data
,
a
this
seems
to
be
a
compatiblity
issue
(
even
though
development
and
live
should
run
the
same
version
of
the
server
at
all
time
)
.
or
-
given
the
lack
of
``
explain
create
table
''
in
t-sql
-
do
you
do
something
that
export
an
existing
database
into
sql-scripts
which
you
can
run
on
the
target
server
?
if
yes
,
is
there
a
tool
that
can
automatically
dump
a
given
database
into
sql
queries
and
that
run
off
the
command
line
?
(
again
,
enterprise
manager/management
studio
express
do
not
count
)
.
and
lastly
-
given
the
fact
that
the
live
database
already
contains
data
,
the
deployment
may
not
involve
creating
all
table
but
rather
checking
the
difference
in
structure
and
alter
table
the
live
one
instead
,
which
may
also
need
data
verification/conversion
when
existing
field
change.
now
,
i
hear
a
lot
of
great
stuff
about
the
red
gate
product
,
but
for
hobby
project
,
the
price
is
a
bit
steep.
so
,
what
are
you
using
to
automatically
deploy
sql
server
databases
from
test
to
live
?
