i
've
been
writing
a
few
web
service
for
a
.net
app
and
now
i
'm
ready
to
consume
them.
i
've
seen
numerous
example
where
there
is
homegrown
code
for
consing
the
service
a
opposed
to
using
the
auto
generated
method
visisl
studio
creates
when
adding
the
web
reference.
is
there
some
advantage
to
this
?
