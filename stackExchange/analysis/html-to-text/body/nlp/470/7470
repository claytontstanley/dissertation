after
a
couple
hour
fighting
with
the
gallery2
rss
module
and
getting
only
the
message
,
``
no
feed
have
yet
been
defined
''
,
i
gave
up
.
based
on
a
google
search
for
``
no
feed
have
yet
been
defined
''
,
this
is
a
pretty
common
problem
.
do
you
have
any
tip
and/or
trick
for
getting
the
gallery2
rss
module
to
work
?
or
any
tip
for
a
relatively-php-ignorant
developer
trying
to
debug
problem
with
this
php
application
?
