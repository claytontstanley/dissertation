virginia
,
there
is
a
wikipedia
.
what
i
'm
asking
here
is
what
you
've
found
unit
testing
to
be
in
your
own
practice
.
it
would
be
helpful
to
know
the
pro
,
con
,
obstacle
to
introducing
unit
testing
,
flaw
in
the
unit
testing
process
,
value
gained
by
unit
testing
,
and
so
on
that
the
developer
here
have
observed
in
their
day
to
day
practice
.
what
we
're
doing
:
i
work
on
a
web
application
w/
an
oracle
backend
.
the
application
ha
been
in
production
for
8+
year
,
and
there
are
ongoing
enhancement
effort
along
with
the
maintenance
work
.
my
development
team
doe
unit
test
scripts
(
uts
)
that
aim
to
walk
a
developer
through
the
unit
test
of
a
given
code
package
.
these
uts
are
2-20
page
word
document
that
describe
the
purpose
of
the
package
,
the
structure
,
and
elaborate
on
given
module
within
a
package
.
the
uts
concludes
with
a
section
that
describes
an
application
test
of
the
package
.
this
doe
n't
sound
like
unit
testing
to
me
.
it
sound
a
lot
more
like
system
integration
testing
w/
a
description
of
the
package
.
it
certainly
is
not
automated
.
with
our
uts
practice
in
it
current
state
,
managing/editing/follwing
the
document
is
not
a
trivial
task
.
and
when
enhancement
or
maintenance
work
to
a
given
package
is
needed
,
there
are
not
strict
testing
procedure
put
in
place
to
guarantee
output
are
satisfactory
.
instead
,
we
have
this
higher
level
uts
to
follow
,
which
doe
not
come
close
to
guaranteeing
correct
output
in
various
code
trace
.
