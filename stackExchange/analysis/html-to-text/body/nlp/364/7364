does
anyone
know
of
a
good
method
for
editing
pdfs
in
php
?
preferably
open-source/zero-license
cost
methods.
:
)
i
am
thinking
along
the
line
of
opening
a
pdf
file
,
replacing
text
in
the
pdf
and
then
writing
out
the
modified
version
of
the
pdf
?
i
have
programmatically
created
pdf
file
in
the
past
using
fpdf
,
but
found
it
a
little
unwieldy
at
time
.
