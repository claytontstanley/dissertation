recently
i
have
been
having
issue
with
firefox
3
on
ubuntu
hardy
heron
.
i
will
click
on
a
link
and
it
will
hang
for
a
while
.
i
do
n't
know
if
it
a
bug
in
firefox
3
or
a
page
running
too
much
client
side
javascript
,
but
i
would
like
to
try
and
debug
it
a
bit
.
so
,
my
question
is
,
is
there
a
way
to
have
some
kind
of
process
explorer
,
or
task
manager
sort
of
thing
for
firefox
3
?
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
see
what
tab
are
using
what
percent
of
my
processor
via
the
javascript
on
that
page
(
or
anything
in
the
page
that
is
causing
cpu/memory
usage
)
.
does
anybody
know
of
a
plugin
that
doe
this
,
or
something
similar
?
has
anyone
else
done
this
kind
of
inspection
another
way
?
i
know
about
firebug
,
but
i
ca
n't
imagine
how
i
would
use
it
to
finger
which
tab
is
using
a
lot
of
resource
.
any
suggestion
or
insight
?
update
:
thanks
orion
for
the
info
!
it
doe
n't
really
answer
the
question
of
having
such
a
process
explorer
,
but
i
think
it
answer
my
problem
,
so
i
'll
mark
yours
a
the
answer
!
i
'm
still
interested
in
some
kind
of
mechanism
to
see
what
my
various
tab
are
doing
with
respect
to
memory
and
javascript
time
,
so
any
such
comment
are
still
welcome
!
