at
work
we
are
currently
still
using
junit3
to
run
our
test
.
we
have
been
considering
switching
over
to
junit4
for
new
test
being
written
but
i
have
been
keeping
an
eye
on
testng
for
a
while
now
.
what
experience
have
you
all
had
with
either
junit4
or
testng
and
which
seems
to
work
better
for
very
large
number
of
test
.
having
flexibility
in
writing
test
is
also
important
to
u
since
our
functional
test
cover
a
wide
aspect
and
need
to
be
written
in
a
variety
of
way
to
get
result
.
old
test
will
not
be
re-written
a
they
do
their
job
just
fine
.
what
i
would
like
to
see
in
new
test
though
is
flexibility
in
the
way
the
test
can
be
written
,
natural
assertion
,
grouping
,
and
easily
distributed
test
execution
.
