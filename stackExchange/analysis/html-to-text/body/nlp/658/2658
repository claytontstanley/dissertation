so
i
know
i
need
to
implement
version
control
,
even
for
just
the
developing
i
do
at
home.
my
issue
is
i
have
read
about
how
great
subversion
is
for
the
past
couple
years.
i
wa
about
to
dedicate
myself
to
learning
this
on
the
side.
but
now
i
am
starting
to
read
about
git
being
the
up
and
coming
version
control
system.
so
should
i
hold
of
and
see
which
one
come
out
on
top
?
are
they
both
winner
in
certain
area
?
one
issue
i
noticed
with
git
,
is
there
is
not
much
for
a
gui
,
which
is
important
to
me.
also
,
would
n't
mind
suggestion
on
how
to
get
started
with
one
or
the
other.
(
tutorial
,
etc
.
