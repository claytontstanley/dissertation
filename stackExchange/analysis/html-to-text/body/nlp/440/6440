i
've
been
using
a
lot
of
new
.net
3.5
feature
in
the
work
that
i
've
been
doing
,
lately
.
the
application
that
i
'm
building
is
intended
for
distribution
among
consumer
who
will
probably
not
have
the
latest
version
(
or
perhaps
any
version
)
of
the
.net
framework
on
their
machine
.
i
went
to
go
download
the
.net
3.5
redistributable
package
only
to
find
out
that
it
's
almost
200
mb
!
this
is
unacceptable
for
my
application
,
because
it
's
supposed
to
be
a
quick
and
painless
consumer
application
that
installs
quickly
and
keep
a
low
profile
on
the
user
's
machine
.
for
user
that
have
.net
3.5
already
installed
,
our
binary
downloads
have
been
instantaneous
,
so
far
.
this
200
mb
gorilla
will
more
than
quadruple
the
size
of
the
download
.
is
there
any
other
option
than
this
redistributable
package
that
i
can
use
to
make
sure
the
framework
is
on
the
machine
that
wo
n't
take
the
user
out
of
our
``
quick
and
painless
''
workflow
?
our
target
time
from
beginning
of
download
to
finalizing
the
install
is
le
than
two
minute
.
is
it
just
not
possible
for
someone
who
doe
n't
already
have
.net
installed
?
