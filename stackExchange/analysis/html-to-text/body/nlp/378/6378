i
'm
working
to
implement
an
export
feature
for
events.
the
link
above
list
ton
of
client
that
support
the
icalendar
standard
,
but
the
``
three
big
one
''
i
can
see
are
apple
's
ical
,
microsoft
's
outlook
,
and
google
's
gmail.
i
'm
starting
to
get
the
feeling
that
each
of
these
client
implement
different
part
of
the
``
standard
''
,
and
i
'm
unsure
of
what
piece
of
information
we
should
be
trying
to
export
from
the
application
so
that
someone
can
put
it
on
their
calendar
(
especially
around
recurrence
)
.
for
example
,
from
what
i
understand
outlook
doe
n't
support
hourly
recurrence.
could
any
of
you
provide
guidance
of
the
``
happy
medium
''
here
from
a
feature
implementation
standpoint
?
secondary
question
,
if
we
decide
to
cut
feature
from
the
export
(
such
a
hourly
recurrence
)
because
it
is
n't
supported
in
outlook
,
should
we
support
it
in
the
application
a
well
?
(
it
is
a
general
purpose
event
scheduling
application
,
with
no
business
specific
use
in
mind
...
so
we
really
are
looking
for
the
happy
medium
)
.
thanks
,
ian
