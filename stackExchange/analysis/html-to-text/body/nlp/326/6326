i
have
the
following
html.erb
code
that
i
'm
looking
to
move
to
haml
:
<
span
class=
''
<
%
=
item.dashboardstatus.cssclass
%
>
''
>
<
%
=
item.dashboardstatus.status
%
>
<
/span
>
what
it
doe
is
associate
the
css
class
of
the
currently
assigned
status
to
the
span
.
how
is
this
done
in
haml
?
i
'm
sure
i
'm
missing
something
really
simple
.
edit
:
gah
.
i
ca
n't
believe
i
did
n't
figure
that
out
on
my
own
.
just
go
to
show
that
two
set
of
eye
are
better
than
one
.
thanks
!
