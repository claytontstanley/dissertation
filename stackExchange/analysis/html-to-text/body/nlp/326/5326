does
anybody
have
some
good
template
(
or
link
to
)
that
they
use
for
software
lifecycle
document
(
feasibility
,
concept
,
requirement
,
architecture
)
?
i
've
taken
some
old
one
i
've
had
from
school
and
slimmed
them
down
a
bit
since
none
of
the
current
project
that
i
work
on
are
to
that
scale
,
but
they
always
feel
somewhat
clugey.
sadly
enough
there
is
n't
any
kind
of
lifecycle
support
here
at
my
current
job
,
so
i
do
n't
have
anything
here
to
base
mine
on
.
