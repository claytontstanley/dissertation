i
am
working
on
a
project
right
now
that
involves
receiving
a
message
from
another
application
,
formatting
the
content
of
that
message
,
and
sending
it
to
a
printer
.
technology
of
choice
is
c
#
window
service
.
the
output
could
be
called
a
report
,
i
suppose
,
but
a
reporting
engine
is
not
necessary
.
a
simple
templating
engine
,
like
stringtemplate
,
or
even
xslt
outputting
html
would
be
fine
.
the
problem
i
'm
having
is
finding
a
free
way
to
print
this
kind
of
output
from
a
service
.
since
it
seems
that
it
will
work
,
i
'm
working
on
a
prototype
using
microsoft
's
rdlc
,
populating
a
local
report
and
then
rendering
it
a
an
image
to
a
memory
stream
,
which
i
will
then
print
.
issues
with
that
are
:
multi-page
printing
will
be
a
big
headache
.
still
have
to
use
printdocument
to
print
the
memory
stream
,
which
is
unsupported
in
a
windows
service
(
though
it
may
work
-
have
n't
gotten
that
far
with
the
prototype
yet
)
if
the
data
coming
across
change
,
i
have
to
change
the
dataset
,
and
the
class
that
the
data
is
being
deserialized
into
.
bad
bad
bad
.
has
anyone
had
to
do
anything
remotely
like
this
?
any
advice
?
i
already
posed
a
question
about
printing
html
without
user
input
,
and
after
wasting
about
3
day
on
that
,
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
can
not
be
done
,
at
least
not
with
any
freely
available
tool
.
all
help
is
appreciated
.
edit
:
we
are
on
version
2.0
of
the
.net
framework
.
