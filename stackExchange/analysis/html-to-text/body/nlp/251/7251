i
'm
a
tech-minded
dev.
i
analyze
,
design
,
code
and
debug
-
and
i
'm
good
at
it.
on
the
other
hand
,
i
'm
not
that
good
with
people
,
especially
those
who
i
think
are
slacking
off
or
not
put
enough
effort
into
learning
new
things.
also
,
i
'm
highly
competitive
and
usually
stubborn.
this
probably
close
the
management
door
for
me
-
i
'm
not
good
at
it
,
and
i
do
n't
like
it.
however
,
i
've
rarely
seen
anyone
advancing
in
this
track
beyond
``
activity
leader
or
``
technical
leader
''
in
a
team
,
and
the
pyramid
get
's
a
lot
narrower
than
it
doe
in
management.
what
track
are
available
to
a
person
like
me
?
how
can
i
keep
``
climbing
the
ladder
''
,
meeting
new
challenge
with
in
rising
scale
of
difficulty
?
i
'm
afraid
that
i
'll
reach
a
peak
where
i
'd
look
ahead
and
say
``
it
's
not
worth
going
in
there
-
either
i
've
done
it
(
tech
)
or
i
do
n't
want
to
(
mgmt
)
''
.
what
track
are
you
people
on
?
(
sorry
if
i
come
off
an
a
an
arrogant
egomaniac
)
