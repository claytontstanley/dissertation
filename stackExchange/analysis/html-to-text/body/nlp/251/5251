hey
all
,
i
've
been
trying
to
get
pretty
chart
to
work
in
gwt
on
our
internal
network.
playing
around
with
gwt-ext
's
chart
is
nice
,
but
it
requires
flash
and
is
really
messy
to
control
(
it
seems
buggy
,
in
general
)
.
i
'd
like
to
hear
about
something
that
work
with
the
least
amount
of
dependency
and
it
also
must
work
without
a
connection
to
the
web
(
so
,
google
'
chart
api
is
n't
a
solution
)
.
edit
:
indeed
,
i
would
rather
a
library
that
is
all
client-side.
thank
you
all
!
