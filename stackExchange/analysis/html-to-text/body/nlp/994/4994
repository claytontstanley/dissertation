i
am
currently
creating
a
master
ddl
for
our
database.
historically
we
have
used
backup/restore
to
version
our
database
,
and
not
maintained
any
ddl
scripts.
the
schema
is
quite
large.
my
current
thinking
:
break
script
into
part
(
possibly
in
separate
script
)
:
table
creation
add
index
add
trigger
add
constraint
each
script
would
get
called
by
the
master
script.
i
might
need
a
script
to
drop
constraint
temporarily
for
testing
there
may
be
orphaned
table
in
the
schema
,
i
plan
to
identify
suspect
tables.
any
other
advice
?
edit
:
also
if
anyone
know
good
tool
to
automate
part
of
the
process
,
we
're
using
ms
sql
2000
(
old
,
i
know
)
.
