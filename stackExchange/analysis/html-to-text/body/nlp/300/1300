i
am
using
msbuild
to
build
my
stuff.
i
want
to
use
cruisecontrol.net
a
by
build
server.
now
,
ccnet
refers
nant
a
lot
,
but
it
look
a
if
ccnet
can
do
most
of
the
stuff
nant
could
do
through
the
project
configuration
and
msbuild.
also
,
nant
seems
a
bit
unsupported
,
with
a
beta
release
that
is
almost
a
year
old
now.
in
short
:
i
am
actually
quite
happy
with
msbuild
(
especially
since
it
's
the
``
official
''
compiler
front
end
)
and
a
bit
uncomfortable
with
nant
,
but
i
do
not
want
to
judge
prematurely.
what
would
be
reason
to
use
nant
over
msbuild
?
especially
with
ccnet
,
which
seems
to
overlap
a
bit
with
nant
in
term
of
feature
(
and
adding
the
automated
build
related
stuff
)
