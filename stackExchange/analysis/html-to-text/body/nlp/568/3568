i
'm
a
mid/seniorish
level
developer
myself
.
i
've
interviewed
many
junior
level
developer
,
fresh
out
of
college
looking
for
their
first
job
.
so
i
've
read
up
on
thing
like
joel
's
guerrilla
guide
to
interviewing
-
http
:
//www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/guerrillainterviewing3.html
and
i
agree
that
it
's
a
great
way
to
structure
that
in-person
meeting
.
a
lot
of
the
stuff
in
there
seems
more
geared
towards
junior
devs
just
getting
started
in
their
career
.
asking
the
guy
to
sketch
out
some
code
,
for
example
.
is
this
kind
of
stuff
relevant
for
when
interviewing
a
senior
developer
?
would
it
be
insulting
to
ask
these
kind
of
question
to
somebody
who
boast
building
entire
enterprise
system
on
his
resume
?
