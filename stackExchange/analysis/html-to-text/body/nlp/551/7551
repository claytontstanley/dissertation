when
designing
a
rest
api
or
service
are
there
any
established
best
practice
for
dealing
with
security
(
authentication
,
authorization
,
identity
management
)
?
when
building
a
soap
api
you
have
ws-security
a
a
guide
and
much
literature
exists
on
the
topic.
i
have
found
le
information
about
securing
rest
endpoints.
while
i
understand
rest
intentionally
doe
not
have
specification
analogous
to
ws-*
i
am
hoping
best
practice
or
recommended
pattern
have
emerged.
any
discussion
or
link
to
relevant
document
would
be
very
much
appreciated.
if
it
matter
,
we
would
be
using
wcf
with
pox/json
serialized
message
for
our
rest
api's/services
built
using
v3.5
of
the
.net
framework
.
