at
my
work
we
are
running
a
group
of
test
that
consist
of
about
3,000
separate
test
case
.
previously
we
were
running
this
entire
test
suite
on
one
machine
,
which
took
about
24-72
hour
to
complete
the
entire
test
run
.
we
now
have
created
our
own
system
for
grouping
and
distributing
the
test
among
about
three
separate
machine
and
the
test
are
prioritized
so
that
the
core
test
get
run
first
for
more
immediate
result
and
the
extra
test
run
when
there
is
an
available
machine
.
i
am
curious
if
anyone
ha
found
a
good
way
to
distribute
their
test
among
several
machine
to
reduce
total
test
time
for
a
complete
run
and
what
tool
were
used
to
achieve
that
.
i
've
done
some
research
and
it
look
like
testng
is
moving
in
this
direction
,
but
it
look
like
it
is
still
under
quite
a
bit
of
development
.
we
do
n't
plan
on
rewriting
any
of
our
test
,
but
a
we
add
new
test
and
test
new
product
or
add-on
i
'd
like
to
be
able
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
we
are
working
with
very
large
number
of
test
.
on
the
other
hand
,
if
we
can
find
a
tool
that
would
help
distribute
our
junit
3.x
test
even
in
a
very
basic
fashion
,
that
would
be
helpful
since
we
would
n't
have
to
maintain
our
own
tooling
to
do
that
.
