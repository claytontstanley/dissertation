a
few
month
back
my
team
switched
our
source
control
over
to
subversion
from
visual
sourcesafe
,
and
we
have
n't
been
happier.
recently
i
've
been
looking
at
team
foundation
server
,
and
at
least
on
the
surface
,
it
seems
very
impressive.
there
is
some
great
integration
with
visual
studio
,
and
lot
of
great
tool
for
dba
's
,
tester
,
project
manager
,
etc.
the
most
obvious
difference
between
these
two
product
is
price.
it
's
hard
to
beat
subversion
(
free
)
.
team
foundation
server
is
quite
expensive
,
so
the
extra
feature
would
really
have
to
kick
subversion
in
the
pants.
my
question
is
:
doe
anyone
have
practical
experience
with
both
?
how
do
they
compare
,
and
is
team
foundation
server
actually
worth
all
the
money
?
