recently
i
've
been
playing
with
an
arduino
board
a
one
of
my
hobby
,
i
'm
having
lot
of
fun
with
it
and
i
'd
like
to
get
into
circuit
etc
in
a
much
bigger
way
.
i
've
done
a
lot
of
research
on
various
avenue
i
could
go
down
,
but
i
'm
sure
some
of
you
guy
know
which
books/sites
are
best
.
i
'm
comfortable
in
c++
and
c
#
,
i
know
there
's
a
board
that
you
can
write
c
#
code
for
(
also
see
the
net
micro
framework
)
and
most
chip
use
c
,
please
feel
free
to
answer
any
number
of
the
following
question
.
1
)
what
are
the
best
books/sites
for
someone
looking
to
break
into
writing
for
microcontrollers
,
eg
i
've
heard
avrfreaks
ha
lot
of
info
(
most
important
question
)
2
)
is
it
true
that
for
the
majority
of
controller
c
is
the
only
choice
?
no
oo
possible
?
3
)
is
there
any
emulation
software
that
would
give
me
a
virtual
microcontroller
and
let
me
try
out
code
with
different
component
etc
connected
to
the
controller
,
so
i
do
n't
have
to
buy
them
to
play
with
em
?
4
)
i
live
in
england
,
what
site
do
you
know
of
that
have
a
wide
range
of
parts/good
price
for
component
etc
?
it
seems
like
other
user
have
interest
in
this
a
well
,
so
i
'm
hoping
someone
in
the
know
notice
this
.
thanks
in
advance
