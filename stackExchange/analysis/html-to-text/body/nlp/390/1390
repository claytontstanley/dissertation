i
'm
setting
up
a
dedicated
sql
server
2005
box
on
windows
server
2008
this
week
,
and
would
like
to
pare
it
down
to
be
a
barebones
a
possible
while
still
being
fully
functional
.
to
that
end
,
the
``
server
core
''
option
sound
appealing
,
but
i
'm
not
clear
about
whether
or
not
i
can
run
sql
server
on
that
sku
.
several
service
are
addressed
on
the
microsoft
website
,
but
i
do
n't
see
any
indication
about
sql
server
.
does
anyone
know
definitively
?
