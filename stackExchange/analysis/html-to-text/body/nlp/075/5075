char
's
are
great
because
they
are
fixed
size
and
thus
make
for
a
faster
table.
they
are
however
limited
to
255
characters.
i
want
to
hold
500
character
but
a
blob
is
variable
length
and
that
's
not
what
i
want.
is
there
some
way
to
have
a
fixed
length
field
of
500
character
in
mysql
or
am
i
going
to
have
to
use
2
char
field
?
