i
have
a
simple
page
with
my
scriptmanager
and
my
updatepanel
,
and
my
contenttemplate
ha
one
listbox
and
one
label
.
i
am
just
trying
to
catch
it
onselectionchanged
so
i
can
update
the
text
in
the
label
.
no
matter
what
setting
i
try
to
tweak
,
i
always
get
a
full-page
postback
.
is
this
really
not
going
to
work
,
or
am
i
just
screwing
this
up
?
thanks
,
chris
