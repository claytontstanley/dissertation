i
would
like
to
use
a
language
that
i
am
familiar
with
-
java
,
c
#
,
ruby
,
php
,
c/c++
,
although
example
in
any
language
or
pseudocode
are
more
than
welcome.
what
is
the
best
way
of
splitting
a
large
xml
document
into
smaller
section
that
are
still
valid
xml
?
for
my
purpose
,
i
need
to
split
them
into
roughly
third
or
fourth
,
but
for
the
sake
of
providing
example
,
splitting
them
into
n
component
would
be
good
.
