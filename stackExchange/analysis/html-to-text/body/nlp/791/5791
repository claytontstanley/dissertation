does
anyone
here
use
vb.net
and
have
a
strong
preference
for
or
against
using
'isnothing
'
a
opposed
to
'is
nothing
'
(
for
example
,
'if
isnothing
(
anobject
)
'
or
if
anobject
is
nothing
...
'
)
?
if
so
,
why
?
edit
:
if
you
think
they
're
both
equally
acceptable
,
do
you
think
it
's
best
to
pick
one
and
stick
with
it
,
or
is
it
ok
to
mix
them
?
