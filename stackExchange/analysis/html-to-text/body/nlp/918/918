i
have
been
dabbling
in
python
for
a
couple
month
now
,
read
the
online
docs/tutorial
and
started
playing
with
django
a
bit
a
well
...
and
i
feel
like
i
am
starting
to
leave
my
formative
toddler
year
and
ready
for
some
more
serious
code
.
most
everything
i
see
is
generally
encapsulated
in
a
single
script
or
so
large
and
unwieldy
i
do
n't
know
where
to
start
.
i
would
really
like
to
see
an
excellent
example
of
some
proper
python
code
,
style
,
organization
etc
.
and
ideally
a
why
associated
with
some
of
those
decision
.
any
idea
for
where
i
should
look
next
?
i
would
prefer
a
simple
console
app
with
at
most
just
a
few
extra
.py
file
(
maybe
one
package
for
good
measure
)
...
oh
,
and
one
more
thing
:
the
reason
this
is
coming
up
is
i
have
quite
a
bit
of
experience
in
java
and
.net
where
it
is
generally
preferred
to
have
one
class
definition
per
source
file
.
that
rarely
seems
to
be
the
case
in
the
python
world
(
at
least
in
my
very
limited
exposure
)
and
it
just
doe
n't
smell
right
to
me
.
so
maybe
this
is
more
enterprise
python
that
hobbyist
python
or
something
.
