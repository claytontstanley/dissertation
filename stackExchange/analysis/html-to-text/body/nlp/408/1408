is
it
possible
to
configure
xampp
to
serve
up
a
file
outside
of
the
htdocs
directory
?
for
instance
,
say
i
have
a
file
:
c
:
\projects\transitcalculator\trunk\transitcalculator.php
and
my
xampp
file
are
normally
served
out
of
:
c
:
\xampp\htdocs\
(
because
that
's
how
it
's
configured
by
default
)
is
there
some
way
to
make
apache
recognize
and
serve
up
my
transitcalculator.php
file
without
moving
it
under
htdocs
?
preferably
i
'd
like
apache
to
serve
up/have
access
to
the
entire
content
of
the
project
directory
,
and
i
do
n't
want
to
move
the
project
directory
under
htdocs.
