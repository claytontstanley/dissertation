i
have
a
self-referential
role
table
that
represents
a
tree
structure
id
[
int
]
auto
increment
name
[
varchar
]
parentid
[
int
]
i
am
using
an
ado.net
datatable
and
dataadapter
to
load
and
save
value
to
this
table.
this
work
if
i
only
create
child
of
existing
rows.
if
i
make
a
child
row
,
then
make
a
child
of
that
child
,
then
update
,
the
temporary
id
value
generated
by
the
datatable
is
going
into
the
parentid
column.
i
have
the
following
data
relation
set
:
dataset.relations.add
(
new
datarelation
(
``
roletorole
''
,
roletable.columns
(
``
id
''
)
,
roletable.columns
(
``
parentid
''
)
)
)
and
when
i
make
new
child
row
in
the
datatable
i
call
the
setparentrow
method
newrow.setparentrow
(
parentrow
)
is
there
something
special
i
have
to
do
to
get
the
id
generation
to
propagate
recursively
when
i
call
update
on
the
dataadapter
?
