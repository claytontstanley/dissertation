i
want
to
be
able
to
display
a
normal
youtube
video
with
overlaid
annotations.
this
consists
of
colored
rectangle
for
each
frame.
the
only
requirement
is
that
this
be
done
programatically.
youtube
ha
annotation
now
,
but
require
you
use
their
front
end
to
create
them
by
hand.
i
want
to
be
able
to
generate
them.
what
's
the
best
way
of
doing
this
?
some
idea
:
build
your
own
flash
player
(
ew
?
)
somehow
draw
over
the
youtube
flash
player.
will
this
work
?
reverse
engineer
&
hijack
youtube
's
annotation
system.
either
messing
with
the
local
file
or
redirecting
it
's
attempt
to
download
the
annotations.
(
using
greasemonkey
?
firefox
plugin
?
)
ideas
that
do
n't
count
:
download
the
video
,
edit
it
,
re-encode
it
,
and
upload
it
:
