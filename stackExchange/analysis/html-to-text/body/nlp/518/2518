i
have
2
sqlite
database
,
one
downloaded
from
a
server
(
server.db
)
,
and
one
used
a
storage
on
the
client
(
client.db
)
.
i
need
to
perform
various
sync
query
on
the
client
database
,
using
data
from
the
server
database.
for
example
,
i
want
to
delete
all
row
in
the
client.db
trole
table
,
and
repopulate
with
all
row
in
the
server.db
trole
table.
another
example
,
i
want
to
delete
all
row
in
the
client.db
tfile
table
where
the
fileid
is
not
in
the
server.db
tfile
table.
in
sql
server
you
can
just
prefix
the
table
with
the
name
of
the
database.
is
there
anyway
to
do
this
in
sqlite
using
adobe
air
?
