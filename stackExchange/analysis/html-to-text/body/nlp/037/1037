what
is
the
best
way
to
display
flash
content
in
a
c
#
winforms
application
?
i
would
like
to
create
a
user
control
(
similar
to
the
current
picturebox
)
that
will
be
able
to
display
image
and
flash
content
.
it
would
be
great
to
be
able
to
load
the
flash
content
from
a
stream
of
sort
rather
than
a
file
on
disk
.
