suppose
i
have
a
stringbuilder
in
c
#
that
doe
this
:
stringbuilder
sb
=
new
stringbuilder
(
)
;
string
cat
=
``
cat
''
;
sb.append
(
``
the
``
)
.append
(
cat
)
.
(
``
in
the
hat
''
)
;
string
s
=
sb.tostring
(
)
;
would
that
be
a
efficient
or
any
more
efficient
a
having
:
string
cat
=
``
cat
''
;
string
s
=
string.format
(
``
the
{
0
}
in
the
hat
''
,
cat
)
;
if
so
,
why
?
edit
after
some
interesting
answer
i
realised
i
probably
should
have
been
a
little
clearer
in
what
i
wa
asking
.
i
wa
n't
so
much
asking
for
which
wa
quicker
at
concatenating
a
string
,
but
which
is
quicker
at
injecting
one
string
into
another
.
in
both
case
above
i
want
to
inject
one
or
more
string
into
the
middle
of
a
predefined
template
string
.
sorry
for
the
confusion
