should
you
set
all
the
object
to
null
(
nothing
in
vb.net
)
once
you
have
finished
with
them
?
i
understand
that
in
.net
it
is
essential
to
dispose
of
any
instance
of
object
that
implement
the
idisposable
interface
to
release
some
resources.
although
the
object
can
still
be
something
after
it
is
disposed
(
hence
the
isdisposed
property
in
form
)
so
i
assume
it
can
still
reside
in
memory
or
at
least
in
part
?
i
also
know
that
when
an
object
go
out
of
scope
it
is
then
marked
for
collection
ready
for
the
next
pas
of
the
garbage
collector
(
although
this
may
take
time
)
.
so
with
this
in
mind
will
setting
it
to
null
speed
up
the
system
releasing
the
memory
a
it
doe
not
have
to
work
out
that
it
is
no
longer
in
scope
and
are
they
any
bad
side
effect
?

currently
i
do
this

of
opinion
