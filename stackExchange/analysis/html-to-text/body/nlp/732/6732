i
've
got
a
website
that
i
've
just
uploaded
onto
the
interwebs
,
and
when
using
firefox
3.0.1
on
ubuntu
i
do
n't
see
the
favicon
;
firefox
3.0.1
on
winxp
show
it
.
why
is
n't
the
favicon
displaying
under
ubuntu
?
it
's
a
favicon.ico
file
in
the
root
directory
,
not
referenced
in
the
meta
tag
;
would
it
work
better
a
a
gif
?
