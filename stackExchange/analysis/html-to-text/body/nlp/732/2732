anyone
explain
this
behavior
?
running
:
#
!
/bin/sh
echo
``
hello
world
''
|
read
var1
var2
echo
$
var1
echo
$
var2

in
nothing
being
ouput
,
while
:
#
!
/bin/sh
echo
``
hello
world
''
>
test.file
read
var1
var2
<
test.file
echo
$
var1
echo
$
var2
produce
the
expected
output
:
hello
world
should
n't
the
pipe
do
in
one
step
what
the
redirection
to
test.file
did
in
the
second
example
?
i
tried
the
same
code
with
both
the
dash
and
bash
shell
and
got
the
same
behavior
from
both
of
them
.
