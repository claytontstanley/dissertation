i
'm
currently
experimenting
with
build
script
,
and
since
i
have
an
asp.net
web
part
under
source
control
,
my
build
script
should
do
that
at
the
end
:
grab
the
``
naked
''
windows
2003
iis
vmware
or
virtual
pc
image
from
the
network
boot
it
up
copy
the
files
from
the
build
folder
to
the
server
install
it
do
whatever
else
is
needed
i
have
never
tried
automating
a
virtual
machine
,
but
i
saw
that
both
vmware
and
virtual
server
offer
automation
facilities.
while
i
can
not
use
virtual
server
(
windows
xp
home
:
-
(
)
,
virtual
pc
works.
does
anyone
here
have
experience
with
either
vmware
server
or
virtual
pc
2007
sp1
in
term
of
automation
?
which
one
is
better
suited
(
i
run
window
,
so
the
platform-independence
of
vmware
doe
not
count
)
and
easier
to
automate
?
