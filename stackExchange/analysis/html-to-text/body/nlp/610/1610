if
i
'm
adding
a
column
to
a
table
in
microsoft
sql
server
,
can
i
control
where
the
column
is
displayed
logically
in
query
?
i
do
n't
want
to
mess
with
the
physical
layout
of
column
on
disk
,
but
i
would
like
to
logically
group
column
together
when
possible
so
that
tool
like
sql
server
management
studio
list
the
content
of
the
table
in
a
convenient
way
.
i
know
that
i
can
do
this
through
sql
management
studio
by
going
into
their
``
design
''
mode
for
table
and
dragging
the
order
of
column
around
,
but
i
'd
like
to
be
able
to
do
it
in
raw
sql
so
that
i
can
perform
the
ordering
scripted
from
the
command
line
.
