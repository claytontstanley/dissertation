alright
,
this
is
a
rather
odd
question
that
doe
n't
have
one
true
answer
:
what
is
the
*
best
||
easiest
to
use
||
most
powerful
||
cleanest
*
gui
api
or
library
(
tk
,
swing
,
qt
,
etc.
)
you
have
had
the
privilege
to
use
?
i
've
had
conversation
with
friend
about
how
annoying
xyz
api
wa
to
deal
with
and
how
someone
could
build
a
better
one
,
and
i
wa
curious
what
other
's
thought
were
on
the
subject.
is
there
a
good
and
straightforward
way
to
implement
a
gui
from
the
programmer
's
standpoint
,
and
ha
someone
done
it
yet
?
