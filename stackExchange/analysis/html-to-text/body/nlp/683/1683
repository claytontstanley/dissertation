i
am
looking
for
the
spiritual
guidance
of
what
is
the
best
practice
around
the
use
of
profile
feature
in
asp.net.
how
do
you
decide
what
should
be
kept
in
the
built
in
user
profile
,
or
if
you
should
just
go
and
create
your
own
db
table
and
add
a
column
for
that
?
for
example
,
a
user
ha
a
zip
code
,
should
i
save
the
zip
code
in
my
own
table
,
or
should
i
add
it
to
the
web.config
xml
profile
and
then
access
it
via
the
user
profile
asp.net
mechanize
?
the
pros/cons
i
can
think
of
are
that
since
i
do
n't
know
the
profile
so
well
,
(
it
is
a
bit
of
a
matrix
right
now
)
i
probably
can
do
whatever
i
want
if
i
go
the
table
route
(
like
,
sql
to
get
all
the
user
in
the
same
zip
code
a
the
current
user
)
,
i
do
n't
know
ifi
can
do
the
same
if
i
use
the
asp.net
profile
.
