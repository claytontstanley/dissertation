which
of
the
following
ha
the
best
performance
?
i
have
seen
method
two
implemented
in
javascript
with
huge
performance
gain
,
however
,
i
wa
unable
to
measure
any
gain
in
c
#
and
wa
wondering
if
the
compiler
already
doe
method
2
even
when
written
like
method
1
.
the
theory
behind
method
2
is
that
the
code
doe
n't
have
to
access
datatable.rows.count
on
every
iteration
,
it
can
simple
access
the
int
c.
method
1
for
(
int
i
=
0
;
i
<
datatable.rows.count
;
i++
)
{
//
do
something
}
method
2
for
(
int
i
=
0
,
c
=
datatable.rows.count
;
i
<
c
;
i++
)
{
//
do
something
}
