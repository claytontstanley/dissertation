c
#
and
.net
ha
become
the
official
programming
platform
at
my
company
for
all
new
it
project
.
i
'm
a
bioinformatics
scientist
with
15
year
of
experience
with
c
,
c++
,
and
perl
.
and
,
fortunately
,
i
'm
not
in
it
,
so
i
do
n't
have
to
do
my
work
using
c
#
.
but
i
anticipate
having
to
work
on
a
project
with
a
c
#
programmer
,
so
it
's
time
for
me
to
learn
c
#
.
i
'm
old-fashioned
,
so
i
like
to
learn
from
book
.
in
your
experience
,
what
book
have
you
found
useful
for
learning
c
