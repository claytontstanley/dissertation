i
really
feel
that
i
should
learn
lisp
and
there
are
plenty
of
good
resource
out
there
to
help
me
do
it
.
i
'm
not
put
off
by
the
complicated
syntax
,
but
where
in
``
traditional
commercial
programming
''
would
i
find
place
it
would
make
sense
to
use
it
instead
of
a
procedural
language
.
is
there
a
commercial
killer-app
out
there
that
's
been
written
in
lisp
?
