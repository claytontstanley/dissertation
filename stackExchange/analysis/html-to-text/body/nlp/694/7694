is
that
even
a
valid
question
?
i
have
a
.net
window
app
that
is
using
mstdc
and
it
throwing
an
exception
:
system.transactions.transactionmanagercommunicationexception
:
network
access
for
distributed

(

)
ha
been
disabled.
please
enable
dtc
for
network
access
in
the
security
configuration
for
msdtc
using
the
component

administrative
tool

)
:
the

the
guide
here
to
able

the
pc
,
on

the

is
installed.
but
the

and
if
so

can
i
resolve
it
?
