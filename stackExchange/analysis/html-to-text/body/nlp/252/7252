we
have
a
junior
programmer
that
simply
doe
n't
write
enough
test
.
i
have
to
nag
him
every
two
hour
,
``
have
you
written
test
?
``
we
've
tried
:
showing
that
the
design
becomes
simpler
showing
it
prevents
defect
making
it
an
ego
thing
saying
only
bad
programmer
don't
this
weekend
2
team
member
had
to
come
to
work
because
his
code
had
a
null
reference
and
he
did
n't
test
it
my
work
requires
top
quality
stable
code
,
and
usually
everyone
'gets
it
'
and
there
's
no
need
to
push
test
through
.
we
know
we
can
make
him
write
test
,
but
we
all
know
the
useful
test
are
those
written
when
you
're
into
it
.
do
you
know
of
more
motivation
?
