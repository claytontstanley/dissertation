original
question
if
you
are
given
n
maximally
distant
color
(
and
some
associated
distance
metric
)
,
can
you
come
up
with
a
way
to
sort
those
color
into
some
order
such
that
the
first
m
are
also
reasonably
close
to
being
a
maximally
distinct
set
?
in
other
word
,
given
a
bunch
of
distinct
color
,
come
up
with
an
ordering
so
i
can
use
a
many
color
a
i
need
starting
at
the
beginning
and
be
reasonably
assured
that
they
are
all
distinct
and
that
nearby
color
are
also
very
distinct
(
e.g.
,
bluish
red
is
n't
next
to
reddish
blue
)
.
randomizing
is
ok
but
certainly
not
optimal.
clarification
:
given
some
large
and
visually
distinct
set
of
color
(
say
256
,
or
1024
)
,
i
want
to
sort
them
such
that
when
i
use
the
first
,
say
,
16
of
them
that
i
get
a
relatively
visually
distinct
subset
of
colors.
this
is
equivalent
,
roughly
,
to
saying
i
want
to
sort
this
list
of
1024
so
that
the
closer
individual
color
are
visually
,
the
farther
apart
they
are
on
the
list
.
