it
seems
like
every
time
i
try
to
create
a
pure
css
layout
it
take
me
much
longer
than
if
i
'd
use
a
table
or
two.
getting
three
column
to
be
of
equal
length
with
different
amount
of
data
in
them
seems
to
require
particular
fancy
hack
,
especially
when
dealing
with
cross-browser
issues.
so
,
my
question
is
this
:
who
are
these
few
table
going
to
hurt
?
tables
seem
to
work
particularly
good
on
tabular
data
-
why
are
they
so
reviled
in
this
day
and
age
?
google.com
ha
a
table
it
source
code
,
so
do
many
other
site
(
stackoverflow
doe
not
by
the
way
)
.
