i
think
most
people
here
understand
the
importance
of
fully
automated
builds.
the
problem
is
one
of
our
project
is
now
using
an
integrated
visual
studio
setup
project
(
vdproj
)
and
ha
recently
been
ported
to
visual
studio
2008.
unfortunatly
,
those
wo
n't
build
in
msbuild
and
calling
devenv.exe
/build
on
2008
just
crash
,
apparently
it
doe
that
on
all
multi
core
computer
(
!
!
!
)
.
so
now
i
have
the
choice
to
either
rollback
to
.net
2.0
and
2005
or
simply
ditch
visual
studio
deployement
,
but
first
,
i
'd
like
a
second
opinion.
anyone
know
of
another
automated
way
to
build
a
.vdproj
that
will
not
require
u
to
open
the
ide
and
click
on
stuff
?
