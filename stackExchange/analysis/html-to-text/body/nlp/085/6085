our
automated
build
machine
need
to
archive
the
version
number
of
the
os
plus
various
tool
used
during
each
build
.
(
in
case
we
ever
need
to
replicate
exactly
the
same
build
later
on
,
perhaps
when
the
machine
is
long
dead
.
)
i
see
the
command
``
msinfo32.exe
''
can
be
used
to
dump
a
whole
load
of
system
version
information
,
which
we
might
a
well
archive
.
does
anyone
know
of
a
way
to
easily
archive
the
version
number
of
the
visual
studio
tool
?
what
mechanism
do
other
developer
use
to
gather
this
kind
of
information
for
archive
purpose
?
extra
information
for
fabio
gomes
.
i
agree
with
you
that
in
5
year
time
it
'll
probably
be
impossible
to
recreate
the
exact
os
and
tool
configuration
(
down
to
the
nearest
security
update
)
.
unfortunately
this
really
come
from
a
contractual
requirement
.
as
part
of
our
deliverable
to
a
customer
we
must
provide
a
copy
of
all
source
code
and
clear
instruction
on
exactly
how
to
replicate
the
build
.
it
's
probably
impossible
for
u
to
meet
this
requirement
perfectly
.
so
-
i
'll
just
mark
your
answer
a
correct
(
i
agree
with
you
that
it
's
practically
impossible
)
,
and
get
on
with
playing
with
the
rest
of
stack
overflow
.
:
)
ps
.
it
would
be
really
great
if
stack
overflow
supported
reply
to
answer
instead
of
having
to
edit
the
original
question..
but
i
see
it
ha
already
been
denied
.
