what
are
your
best
practice
around
creating
flat
file
database
structure
in
php
?
a
lot
of
the
more
mature
php
flat
file
framework
i
see
out
there
attempt
to
implement
sql-like
query
syntax
,
which
is
over
the
top
for
my
purpose
in
most
case
(
i
would
just
use
a
database
at
that
point
)
.
are
there
any
elegant
trick
out
there
to
get
good
performance
and
feature
with
the
small
code
overhead
one
would
want
by
taking
on
this
problem
in
the
first
place
?
