i
already
know
the
basic
of
regex
but
i
'm
not
sure
where
to
go
from
here
,
i
'm
looking
for
both
a
good
and
above
all
easy
to
understand
guide
but
i
am
also
looking
for
thing
to
use
regex
's
for
,
it
's
all
well
and
good
reading
about
it
but
if
you
never
use
them
then
they
will
not
stick
in
your
mind.
i
have
already
found
regular-expressions.info
but
i
'm
sure
there
are
more
.
