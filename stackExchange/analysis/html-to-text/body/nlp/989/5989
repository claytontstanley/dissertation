i
've
been
programming
since
college
,
wa
a
hobbyist
programmer
a
a
kid
,
but
never
got
serious
until
i
wa
a
freshman
.
that
wa
almost
a
decade
and
a
half
ago
.
one
thing
i
've
noticed
is
that
when
people
reach
a
certain
point
in
their
skill
they
never
really
move
beyond
that
.
that
is
if
they
suck
a
a
developer
when
you
hire
them
,
they
will
always
suck
.
10
year
of
c
#
experience
doe
n't
necessarily
make
you
a
better
developer
than
someone
with
6
month
of
experience
.
(
yeah
,
yeah
,
some
people
will
get
angry
at
reading
this
,
but
it
's
true
,
live
with
it
)
.
so
my
question
is
,
just
how
the
hell
do
you
get
to
be
one
of
those
super
programming
freak
that
everyone
worship
?
i
've
been
doing
coding
puzzle
a
often
a
i
can
--
example
:
reverse
a
string
in
place
using
no
swap
buffer
.
(
that
is
a
fun
one
)
and
i
've
noticed
myself
get
a
little
sharper
.
i
'm
not
improving
a
fast
a
i
wish
i
could
so
i
would
love
to
hear
some
tip
from
people
here
.
