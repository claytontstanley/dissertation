the
setting
:
the
program
in
question
try
to
post
form
data
via
an
ajax
call
to
a
target
procedure
contained
in
the
same
package
a
the
caller
.
this
is
done
for
a
site
that
us
a
secure
connection
(
http
)
.
the
technology
used
here
is
plsql
and
the
dojo
javascript
library
.
the
development
tool
is
basically
a
text
editor
.
code
snippet
:
function
testpost
(
)
{
dojo.xhrpost
(
{
url
:
''dr_tm_w_0120.test_post
''
,
form
:
''orgform
''
,
load
:
testpostxhrcallback
,
error
:
testpostxhrerror
}
)
;
}
function
testpostxhrcallback
(
data
,
ioargs
)
{
alert
(
''post
callback
''
)
;
try
{
dojo.byid
(
``
messagediv
''
)
.innerhtml
=
data
;
}
catch
(
ex
)
{
if
(
ex.name
==
``
typeerror
''
)
{
alert
(
``
a
type
error
occurred
.
``
)
;
}
}
return
data
;
}
function
testpostxhrerror
(
data
,
ioargs
)
{
alert
(
data
)
;
alert
(
''error
when
retrieving
data
from
the
server
!
''
)
;
return
data
;
}
the
problem
:
when
using
ie6
(
which
the
entire
user-base
us
)
,
the
response
sent
back
from
the
server
is
a
404
error
.
observations
:
the
program
work
fine
in
firefox
.
the
calling
procedure
can
not
target
any
procedure
within
the
same
package
.
the
calling
procedure
can
target
outside
site
(
both
http
,
http
)
.
the
other
ajax
call
in
the
package
that
are
not
post
of
form
data
work
fine
.
i
've
searched
the
internet
and
consulted
with
senior-skilled
team
member
and
have
n't
discovered
anything
that
satisfactorily
address
the
issue
.
*tried
q
&
a
over
at
dojo
support
forum
.
the
questions
:
what
troubleshooting
technique
do
you
recommend
?
what
troubleshooting
tool
do
you
recommend
for
https
analyzing
?
any
hypothesis
on
what
the
issue
might
be
?
any
idea
for
workarounds
that
are
n't
total
(
bad
)
hack
?
ed
.
the
solution
lomaxx
,
thx
for
the
fiddler
tip
.
you
have
no
idea
how
awesome
it
wa
to
get
that
and
use
it
a
a
debugging
tool
.
after
starting
it
up
this
is
what
i
found
and
how
i
fixed
it
(
at
least
in
the
short
term
)
:
ef
fri
,
8
aug
2008
14:01:26
gmt
dr_tm_w_0120.test_post
:
signature
(
parameter
name
)
mismatch
variables
in
form
not
in
procedure
:
so1_displayed_
,
po1_displayed_
,
rwa2_displayed_
,
dd1_displayed_
non-default
variables
in
procedure
not
in
form
:
0
after
seeing
that
message
from
the
server
,
i
kicked
around
fiddler
a
bit
more
to
see
what
else
i
could
learn
from
it
.
found
that
there
's
a
webforms
tab
that
show
the
value
in
the
web
form
.
would
n't
you
know
it
,
the
``
xxx_displayed_
''
field
above
were
in
it
.
i
do
n't
really
understand
yet
why
these
field
exist
,
because
i
did
n't
create
them
explicitly
in
the
web
plsql
code
.
but
i
do
understand
now
that
the
target
procedure
ha
to
include
them
a
parameter
to
work
correctly
.
again
,
this
is
only
in
the
case
of
ie6
for
me
,
a
firefox
worked
fine
.
well
,
that
the
short
term
answer
and
hack
to
fix
it
.
hopefully
,
a
little
more
work
in
this
area
will
lead
to
a
better
understanding
of
the
fundamental
going
on
here
.
