i
have
tried
(
in
vain
)
to
convince
my
team
that
we
should
use
project
planning
software.
i
see
it
a
a
great
way
to
plan
out
our
project
and
determine
deadline
for
deliverables.
they
see
it
a
a
hindrance
to
productivity.
is
there
some
grand
arguement
that
i
'm
missing
here
?
i
would
absolutely
love
to
see
how
long
we
planned
for
milestone
x
,
then
how
much
time
it
took
to
complete
milestone
x.
that
information
is
invaluable
to
me.
but
,
they
just
do
n't
see
the
value
.
