using
firebug
v1.20b7
with
firefox
v3.0.1
i
use
firebug
a
lot
for
web
devlopment.
i
have
very
often
the
problem
that
firebug
wo
n't
show
it
web
console
for
seeing
the
posts
and
gets.
i
can
view
all
the
other
tab
,
including
the
net
tab
that
give
me
a
lot
of
the
same
information
that
the
console
tab
does.
curious
if
anyone
else
ha
had
this
problem
,
and
maybe
a
solution
,
or
maybe
this
is
a
bug
of
firebug.
thanks
