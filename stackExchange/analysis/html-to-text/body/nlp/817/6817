i
'm
working
on
a
project
were
we
need
more
performance.
over
time
we
've
continued
to
evolve
the
design
to
work
more
in
parallel
(
both
threaded
and
distributed
)
.
then
latest
step
ha
been
to
move
part
of
it
onto
a
new
machine
with
16
cores.
i
'm
finding
that
we
need
to
rethink
how
we
do
thing
to
scale
to
that
many
core
in
a
shared
memory
model.
for
example
the
standard
memory
allocator
is
n't
good
enough.
what
resource
would
people
recommend
?
so
far
i
've
found
sutter
's
column
dr.
dobbs
to
be
a
good
start.
i
just
got
the
art
of
multiprocessor
programming
and
the
o'reilly
book
on
intel
threading
building
blocks
