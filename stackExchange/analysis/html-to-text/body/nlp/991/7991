i
'm
using
the
.netcf
(
windows
mobile
)
graphics
class
and
the
drawstring
(
)
method
to
render
a
single
character
to
the
screen.
the
problem
is
that
i
ca
n't
seem
to
get
it
centered
properly.
no
matter
what
i
set
for
the
y
coordinate
of
the
location
of
the
string
render
,
it
always
come
out
lower
than
that
and
the
larger
the
text
size
the
greater
the
y
offset.
for
example
,
at
text
size
12
,
the
offset
is
about
4
,
but
at
32
the
offset
is
about
10.
i
want
the
character
to
vertically
take
up
most
of
the
rectangle
it
's
being
drawn
in
and
be
centered
horizontally.
here
's
my
basic
code.
``
this
''
is
referencing
the
user
control
it
's
being
drawn
in.

yes
,
i
know
there
is
the
label
control
that
i
could
use
instead
and
set
the
centering
with
that
,
but
i
actually
do
need
to
do
this
manually
with
the
graphics
class
.
