there
are
situation
(

a
form
submission
)
that
may
require
a
redirecttoaction

one
such
situation
is
when
you
encounter
validation
error
after
a
form
submission
and
need
to
redirect
back
to
the
form
,
but
would
like
the
url
to
reflect
the
url
of
the
form
,
not
the
action
page
it
submits
to
.
as
i
require
the
form
to
contain
the
originally
posted
data
,
for
user
convenience
,
a
well
a
validation
purpose
,
how
can
i
pas
the
data
through
the
redirecttoaction
(
)
?
if
i
use
the
viewdata
parameter
,
my
post
parameter
will
be
changed
to
get
