given
the
constraint
of
only
using
t-sql
in
sql
server
2005
,
is
there
a
better
way
to
remove
the
decimal
point
from
a
money
datatype
than
a
conversion
to
a
varchar
(
here
implicitly
)
and
then
a
replace
of
the
decimal
point
?
here
is
what
i
have
currently
.
select
replace
(
1.23
,
'
.
'
,
''
)
,
replace
(
19.99
,
'
.
'
,
''
)
which
return
the
desired
123
and
1999
,
but
i
wa
wondering
if
there
wa
a
better
way
.
any
thought
?
