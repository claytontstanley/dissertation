i
've
been
tasked
(
by
my
wife
)
with
creating
a
program
to
allow
her
to
track
the
family
tree
on
both
side
of
our
family.
does
anyone
know
of
a
cost
effective
(
free
)
control
to
represent
this
type
of
information.
what
i
'm
looking
for
is
a
modified
org-chart
type
chart/tree.
the
modification
is
that
any
node
should
have
2
parent
node
(
e.g.
a
child
should
have
a
mother/father
)
.
the
solution
i
've
came
up
with
so
far
is
to
have
2
tree
,
an
ancestor
tree
and
a
descendant
tree
,
with
the
individual
being
inspected
a
the
root
node
for
each
tree.
it
work
,
but
is
sort
of
clunky.
i
'm
working
primarily
in
c
#
winforms
,
so
.net
type
control
or
source
code
is
preferrable.
thanks
.
