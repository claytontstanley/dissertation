i
have
a
directory
structure
like
the
following
;
/script.php
/inc/include1.php
/inc/include2.php
/objects/object1.php
/objects/object2.php
/soap/soap.php
now
,
i
use
those
object
in
both
script.php
and
/soap/soap.php
,
i
could
move
them
,
but
i
want
the
directory
structure
like
that
for
a
different
reason
.
when
executing
script.php
the
include
path
is
inc/include.php
and
when
executing
/soap/soap.php
it
's
../inc
,
absolute
path
work
,
/mnt/webdev/
[
project
name
]
/inc/include1.php
...
but
it
's
an
ugly
solution
if
i
ever
move
the
directory
to
a
different
location
.
so
is
there
a
way
to
use
relative
path
,
or
a
way
to
programically
generate
the
``
/mnt/webdev/
[
project
name
]
/
''
?
