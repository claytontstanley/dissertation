i
have
a
project
that
i
'm
currently
working
on
but
it
currently
only
support
the
.net
framework
2.0.
i
love
linq
,
but
because
of
the
framework
version
i
ca
n't
use
it.
what
i
want
is
n't
so
much
the
orm
side
of
thing
,
but
the
``
queryability
''
(
is
that
even
a
word
?
)
of
linq.
so
far
the
closest
is
llblgen
but
if
there
wa
something
even
lighter
weight
that
could
just
do
the
querying
for
me
that
would
be
even
better.
i
've
also
looked
at
nhibernate
which
look
like
it
could
go
close
to
doing
what
i
want
,
but
it
ha
a
pretty
steep
learning
curve
and
the
mapping
file
do
n't
get
me
overly
excited.
if
anyone
is
aware
of
something
that
will
give
me
a
similar
query
interface
to
linq
(
or
even
better
,
how
to
get
linq
to
work
on
the
.net
2.0
framework
)
i
'd
really
like
to
hear
about
it
.
