finally
i
get
to
post
my
Ä±
's
and
i
's
a
promised
...
i
've
found
that
ms
indexing
service
return
incomplete
result
when
searching
for
document
with
turkish
content.
it
seems
to
choke
especially
regarding
the
(
incorrectly-named
)
4i
problem
.
apparently
,
ms
ha
fixed
this
problem
with
a
windows
2000
http
:
//support.microsoft.com/kb/325333
service
pack
,
but
the
bug
seems
to
be
resurrected
with
windows
xp
&
2003.
anybody
us
indexing
service
in
their
line
of
work
?
similar
problem
with
other
non-english
locale
?
any
solution
?
