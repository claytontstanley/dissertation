i
'm
not
trying
to
start
a
``
which
language
is
better
''
argument
here
,
so
please
do
n't
go
there
.
i
typically
use
php
for
most
of
my
web
development
(
mostly
because
hosting
is
cheap
)
,
but
for
various
reason
i
'm
looking
to
use
asp.net
for
a
couple
new
project
.
but
one
of
the
major
reason
i
've
stayed
away
from
asp.net
up
until
now
is
the
cost
.
i
've
seen
some
budget
hosting
option
,
but
they
always
seem
a
little
sketchy
to
me
.
from
what
i
've
generally
found
,
that
's
just
the
way
the
hosting
scene
look
for
asp.net
unless
you
want
to
go
dedicated
.
does
anyone
have
any
good
suggestion
for
a
solid
asp.net
host
with
a
good
feature
set
and
reliability
for
my
money
?
also
,
are
there
any
option
out
there
along
the
line
of
amazon
's
elastic
compute
cloud
?
and
yes
,
i
know
...
mono
.
i
'm
talking
about
windows
based
``
grid
''
hosting
option
?
