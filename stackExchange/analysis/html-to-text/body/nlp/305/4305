are
there
any
good
grid-hosting
company
out
there
that
offer
.net
stack
?
something
like
mediatemple
-
which
wo
n't
host
the
world
fastest
website
,
but
for
the
price
is
far
better
than
``
shared
hosting
''
.
i
've
used
rackspace
's
mosso
,
but
it
sucked
-
it
never
felt
like
a
normal
.net
stack
(
caching
wa
odd
,
site
recompilation
wa
odd
)
.
