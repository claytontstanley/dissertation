let
's
say
you
create
a
wizard
in
an
html
form.
one
button
go
back
and
one
go
forward.
since
the
``
back
''
button
appears
first
in
the
markup
,
when
you
press
enter
it
will
use
that
button
to
submit
the
form.
ex
:
<
form
>
<
input
type=
''
text
''
name=
''
field1
''
/
>
<
!
--
put
your
cursor
in
this
field
and
press
enter
--
>
<
input
type=
''
submit
''
name=
''
prev
''
value=
''
previous
page
''
/
>
<
!
--
this
is
the
button
that
will
submit
--
>
<
input
type=
''
submit
''
name=
''
next
''
value=
''
next
page
''
/
>
<
!
--
but
this
is
the
button
that
i
want
to
submit
--
>
<
/form
>
what
i
would
like
to
do
,
is
get
to
decide
which
button
is
used
to
submit
the
form
when
a
user
press
enter.
that
way
,
when
you
press
enter
the
wizard
will
move
to
the
next
page
,
not
the
previous.
do
you
have
to
use
tabindex
to
do
this
?
