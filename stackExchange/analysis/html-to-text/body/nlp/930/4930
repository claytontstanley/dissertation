i
'm
developing
a
sharepoint
application
and
use
.net
ajaxcontroltoolkit
library
,
we
are
adding
a
custom
aspx
page
to
the
sharepoint
.
sharepoint
2007
run
in
quirk
mode
so
i
've
made
some
modification
to
the
ajax
library
to
make
it
behave
like
it
normally
should
.
the
problem
is
,
the
other
team
already
use
ajax
library
and
it
is
a
different
version
with
mine
.
this
cause
conflict
because
there
could
be
only
one
dll
in
the
bin
folder
with
the
same
name
.
from
what
i
know
,
.net
should
be
able
to
handle
this
situation
easily
.
i
've
tried
using
strong
name
and
gac
to
solve
it
,
but
it
still
refer
to
the
dll
in
the
bin
folder
.
if
there
is
no
ajaxcontroltoolkit.dll
in
the
bin
folder
,
the
application
will
simply
fail
to
load
the
assembly
.
if
i
use
complete
assembly
information
on
my
like
this
<
%
@
register
tagprefix=
''
ajaxcontroltoolkit
''
namespace=
''
ajaxcontroltoolkit
''
assembly=
''
ajaxcontroltoolkit
,
version=1.0.299.18064
,
publickeytoken=12345678abcdefgh
,
culture=neutral
''
%
>
it
give
me
compiler
error
cs0433
can
someone
help
me
on
how
to
use
multiple
version
of
assembly
in
an
application
?
