i
use
ankhsvn
and
visual
studio
2005
and
2008
.
now
,
one
thing
that
bug
me
is
that
ankh
doe
not
really
work
with
asp.net
site
.
i
can
not
add
them
properly
to
a
repository
and
it
wo
n't
detect
change
,
especially
because
the
site
is
on
a
remote
server
accessed
through
frontpage
extensions
(
file
=
>
open
site
)
.
what
are
the
alternative
?
does
a
better
plug-in
exist
?
manually
downloading
the
file
through
ftp
and
using
tortoisesvn
or
svn.exe
is
not
really
the
level
of
integration
i
want
:
)
i
want
to
stay
within
the
visual
studio
ide
when
possible
.
also
,
i
do
not
control
the
remote
server
,
so
i
can
not
install
anything
on
it
,
which
mean
the
whole
change
tracking/comparison
to
repository
ha
to
be
done
on
my
machine
.
