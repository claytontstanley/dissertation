generally
when
i
use
clickonce
when
i
build
a
vb.net
program
but
it
ha
a
few
downside
.
i
've
never
really
used
anything
else
,
so
i
'm
not
sure
what
my
option
are
.
downsides
to
clickonce
:
consists
of
multiple
file
-
seems
easier
to
distribute
one
file
than
manageing
a
bunch
of
file
and
the
downloader
to
download
those
file
.
you
have
to
build
it
again
for
cd
installation
(
for
when
the
end
user
do
n't
have
internet
)
program
doe
not
end
up
in
program
files
-
it
end
up
hidden
away
in
some
application
catch
folder
,
making
it
much
harder
to
shortcut
to
.
pros
to
clickonce
:
it
work
.
magically
.
and
it
's
built
into
visualstudio
2008
express
.
makes
it
easy
to
upgrade
the
application
.
does
windows
installer
do
these
thing
a
well
?
i
know
it
dose
n't
have
any
of
the
clickonce
con
,
but
it
would
be
nice
to
know
if
it
also
ha
the
clickonce
pro
.
update
:
i
ended
up
using
wix
2
(
wix
3
wa
available
but
at
the
time
i
did
the
project
,
no
one
had
a
competent
tutorial
)
.
it
wa
nice
because
it
supported
the
three
thing
i
(
eventually
)
needed
.
an
optional
start-up-with-windows
shortcut
,
a
start-up-when-the-installer-is-done
option
,
and
three
paragraph
of
text
that
my
bos
think
will
keep
us
from
clicking
the
wrong
option
.
