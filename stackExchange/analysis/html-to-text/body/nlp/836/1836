ok
.
this
is
a
bit
of
a
vanity
app
,
but
i
had
a
situation
today
at
work
where
i
wa
in
a
training
class
and
the
machine
wa
set
to
lock
every
10
minute
.
well
,
if
the
trainer
got
excited
about
talking
-
a
opposed
to
changing
slide
-
the
machine
would
lock
up
.
i
'd
like
to
write
a
teeny
app
that
ha
nothing
but
a
taskbar
icon
that
doe
nothing
but
move
the
mouse
by
1
pixel
every
4
minute
.
i
can
do
that
in
3
way
with
delphi
(
my
strong
language
)
but
i
'm
moving
to
c
#
for
work
and
i
'd
like
to
know
the
path
of
least
resistance
there
.
