i
probably
spend
far
too
much
time
trying
to
make
my
visual
interface
look
good
,
and
while
i
'm
pretty
adept
at
finding
the
right
match
between
usability
and
style
one
area
i
am
hopeless
at
is
making
nice
looking
icon
.
how
do
you
people
overcome
this
(
i
'm
sure
common
)
problem
?
i
'm
thinking
of
thing
like
image
on
button
and
perhaps
most
important
of
all
,
the
actual
application
icon
.
do
you
rely
on
third
party
designer
,
in
or
out
of
house
?
or
do
you
know
of
some
hidden
website
that
offer
lot
of
icon
for
u
to
use
?
i
've
tried
google
but
i
seem
to
find
either
expensive
package
that
are
very
specific
,
million
of
star
trek
icon
or
icon
that
look
abysmal
at
16x16
which
is
my
preferred
size
on
in-application
button
.
any
help/advice
appreciated
.
