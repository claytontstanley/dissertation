i
run
into
a
situation
every
couple
of
month
where
i
need
to
develop
a
solution
that
's
scheduled
to
run
periodically
,
but
i
have
n't
found
a
way
to
handle
this
in
windows
that
i
'm
entirely
happy
with.
every
time
i
do
it
,
i
end
up
feeling
corralled
into
using
a
windows
service
,
which
seems
to
be
an
unacceptable
amount
of
overhead
for
something
i
could
do
with
a
cron
job
in
unix.
am
i
missing
something
here
?
what
have
you
used
to
schedule
an
application
in
windows
?
