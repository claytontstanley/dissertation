i
've
been
doing
bit
and
piece
of
work
in
lingo
while
helping
a
friend
with
some
project
he
's
working
on
,
but
i
have
n't
found
any
good
resource
for
actually
learning
the
language
.
i
'm
sure
i
could
pick
up
an
old
book
somewhere
that
explains
it
,
but
i
really
just
want
a
quick
lesson
and
i
think
a
website
with
some
sample
code
and
function
reference
would
be
perfect
.
does
this
exist
?
my
experience
searching
for
lingo
documentation
in
the
past
lead
me
to
believe
that
it
's
just
not
on
the
web
anywhere
.
