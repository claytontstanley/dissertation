the
application
my
team
is
currently
developing
ha
a
dll
that
is
used
to
perform
all
database
access.
the
application
can
not
use
a
trusted
connection
because
the
database
is
behind
a
firewall
and
the
domain
server
is
not.
so
it
appears
that
the
connection
string
need
to
have
a
db
username
and
password.
the
dll
currently
ha
the
database
connection
string
hard
coded
,
but
i
do
n't
want
to
do
this
when
we
launch
a
the
assembly
can
be
disassembled
and
the
username
and
password
would
be
right
there
in
the
open.
one
of
the
requirement
is
that
the
password
need
to
be
changed
once
every
few
month
,
so
we
would
need
to
roll
that
out
to
our
internal
user
base.
is
there
a
way
to
store
the
password
encrypted
in
such
a
way
we
can
easily
distribute
to
the
entire
user
base
without
storing
it
in
the
assembly
?
thanks
in
advance
!
update
:
thanks
to
everyone
who
's
answered.
i
'll
try
to
answer
some
of
the
question
back
to
me
...
the
data
dll
is
used
by
both
asp.net
webforms
and
vb.net
winforms.
i
understand
that
applications
can
have
their
own
config
file
,
but
i
have
n't
seen
anything
on
config
file
for
dlls.
unfortunately
,
i
ca
n't
get
to
the
jon
galloway
post
at
work
so
i
ca
n't
judge
if
that
will
work.
from
a
development
standpoint
,
we
do
n't
want
to
use
web
service
inhouse
,
but
may
be
providing
them
to
third
party
sometime
next
year.
i
do
n't
think
impersonation
will
work
because
we
ca
n't
authenticate
the
user
through
the
firewall.
as
a
user
(
or
former
user
)
can
be
an
attacker
,
we
're
keeping
it
from
everyone
!
