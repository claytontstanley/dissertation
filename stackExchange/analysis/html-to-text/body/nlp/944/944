i
'm
maintaining
a
.net
1.1
application
,
and
one
of
the
thing
i
've
been
tasked
with
is
making
sure
the
user
doe
n't
see
any
unfriendly
error
notification
.
i
've
added
handler
to
application.threadexception
and
appdomain.currentdomain.unhandledexception
,
which
do
get
called
.
my
problem
is
that
the
standard
clr
error
dialog
is
still
displayed
(
before
the
exception
handler
is
called
)
.
jeff
talk
about
this
problem
on
his
blog
here
and
here
.
but
there
's
no
solution
.
so
what
is
the
standard
way
in
.net
1.1
to
handle
uncaught
exception
and
display
a
friendly
dialog
box
?
edit
:
jeff
's
response
wa
marked
a
the
correct
answer
,
because
the
link
he
provided
ha
the
most
complete
information
on
how
to
do
what
's
required
.
