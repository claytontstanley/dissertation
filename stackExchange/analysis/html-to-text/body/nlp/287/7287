lately
i
had
to
change
some
code
on
older
system
where
not
all
of
the
code
ha
unit
tests.
before
making
the
change
i
want
to
write
test
,
but
each
class
created
a
lot
of
dependency
and
other
anti-patterns
which
made
testing
quite
hard.
obviously
,
i
wanted
to
refactor
the
code
to
make
it
easier
to
test
,
write
the
test
and
then
change
it.
is
this
the
way
you
'd
do
it
?
or
would
you
spend
a
lot
of
time
writing
the
hard-to-write
test
that
would
be
mostly
removed
after
the
refactoring
will
be
completed
?
any
insight
are
welcome
!
