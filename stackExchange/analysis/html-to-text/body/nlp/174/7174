recently
i
had
to
develop
a
sharepoint
workflow
,
and
i
found
the
experience
quite
honestly
the
most
painful
programming
task
i
've
ever
had
to
tackle
.
one
big
problem
i
had
wa
the
problem
i
encountered
when
i
had
to
step
through
it
in
the
debugger
.
there
's
an
article
on
how
to
debug
a
sharepoint
workflow
here
that
tell
you
how
to
set
breakpoints
etc
.
this
involves
copying
the
.pdb
file
into
the
gac
alongside
the
.dll
file
containing
your
workflow
.
you
have
to
do
this
from
a
command
prompt
(
or
a
batch
file
)
because
windows
explorer
doe
n't
let
you
view
the
relevant
subdirectory
of
c
:
\windows\assembly
.
however
,
if
you
do
this
,
the
next
time
you
try
to
deploy
the
workflow
from
within
visual
studio
,
it
complains
that
it
ca
n't
be
deployed
because
``
the
file
may
not
be
signed
''
and
if
you
attempt
to
copy
the
new
version
of
the
dll
into
the
gac
,
it
tell
you
that
the
.dll
file
is
locked
.
i
've
found
that
some
of
the
time
,
you
can
get
round
this
by
doing
an
iisreset
,
but
on
other
occasion
you
have
to
restart
visual
studio
and
there
have
been
frequent
time
when
i
've
even
had
to
reboot
the
computer
altogether
because
some
mystery
process
ha
locked
the
file
.
when
i
do
n't
use
the
debugger
,
on
the
other
hand
,
everything
work
just
fine
.
does
anyone
know
of
a
simpler
way
of
debugging
workflow
than
this
?
