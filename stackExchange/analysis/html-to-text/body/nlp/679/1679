i
'm
writing
an
app
to
help
facilitate
some
research
,
and
part
of
this
involves
doing
some
statistical
calculations.
right
now
,
the
researcher
are
using
a
program
called
spss
.
part
of
the
output
that
they
care
about
look
like
this
:
they
're
really
only
concerned
about
the
'f
'
and
'sig.
'
values.
my
problem
is
that
i
have
no
background
in
stats
,
and
i
ca
n't
figure
out
what
the
test
are
called
,
or
how
to
calculate
them.
i
thought
the
'f
'
value
might
be
the
result
of
the
f-test
,
but
after
following
the
step
given
on
wikipedia
,
i
got
a
result
that
wa
different
from
what
spss
give
.
