in
ruby
1.8
,
there
are
subtle
difference
between
proc/lambda
on
the
one
hand
,
and
proc.new
on
the
other
.
what
are
those
difference
?
can
you
give
guideline
on
how
to
decide
which
one
to
choose
?
in
ruby
1.9
,
proc
and
lambda
are
different
.
what
's
the
deal
?
edit
@
mike
stone
:
there
's
no
difference
between
1.8
and
1.9
in
this
regard
.
@
accordeon
guy
:
that
's
the
difference
i
had
in
mind
,
but
i
do
n't
think
it
's
the
whole
story
.
what
about
next/break/return
in
procs
?
what
about
ruby
1.9
?
what
about
scope
,
and
returning
procs
from
a
method
?
