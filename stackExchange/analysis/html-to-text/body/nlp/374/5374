i
would
have
thought
this
would
be
an
easy
one
to
google
,
but
i
've
been
unsucessful.
i
want
to
assign
a
variable
the
value
out
of
an
attribute
(
easy
so
far
)
then
use
that
variable
to
select
another
node
based
on
the
value
of
that
attribute.
ex
:
<
xsl
:
variable
name=
''
myid
''
select=
''
@
id
''
/
>
<
xsl
value-of
select=
''
//root/some/other/path/where
[
@
id=
'
{
@
myid
}
'
]
/
@
name
/
>
that
doe
not
work.
if
i
replace
the
{
@
myid
}
with
the
value
that
is
in
the
variable
then
it
doe
find
the
right
node
,
but
doign
it
this
way
produce
nothing.
i
'm
sure
i
'm
missing
something
,
or
perhaps
there
is
a
different
way
to
do
it.
the
context
is
that
there
is
related
data
under
different
top-level
node
that
share
the
same
id
value
so
i
need
to
get
the
related
node
in
my
template
.
