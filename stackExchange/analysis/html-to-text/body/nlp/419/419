part
of
my
everyday
work
is
maintaining
and
extending
legacy
vb6
application
.
a
common
engine
is
written
in
c/c++
and
vb6
us
these
function
in
order
to
improve
performance
.
when
it
come
to
asynchronous
programming
,
a
c
interface
is
not
enough
and
we
rely
on
com
control
to
fire
event
to
vb6
.
my
problem
is
that
when
i
register
the
control
in
vb6
,
vb
load
this
control
in
memory
and
doe
not
unload
it
until
i
quit
the
vb6
ide
.
as
the
control
is
loaded
the
whole
time
,
i
am
unable
to
recompile
it
in
vc6
,
because
the
dll
file
is
locked
.
a
solution
i
found
is
not
to
enable
the
control
in
vb
but
use
the
createobject
(
)
with
the
full
name
of
my
control
.
the
problem
then
is
that
i
must
declare
my
control
a
an
object
because
vb6
know
nothing
of
the
interface
i
am
using
and
i
do
not
have
access
to
intellisense
,
which
is
a
pain
.
any
idea
how
i
can
tell
vb6
to
unload
control
after
quitting
the
application
?
or
directly
in
the
ide
?
