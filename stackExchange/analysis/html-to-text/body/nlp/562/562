uploading
my
first
decently
sized
web
app
to
my
shared
host
provided
me
with
a
fresh
set
of
challenge
,
by
which
i
mean
,
sleepless
nights.
the
issue
wa
that
i
had
most
certainly
not
developed
my
application
for
medium
trust
(
or
had
any
clue
what
that
was.
)
i
mitigated
all
of
the
issue
,
save
one.
i
had
written
an
installer
for
the
admin
to
be
able
to
specify
their
connectionstring
and
other
preference
,
but
i
can
not
find
a
way
to
write
to
a
web.config
in
medium
trust.
does
anyone
have
a
solution
,
or
should
i
just
be
putting
preference
in
another
file
?
