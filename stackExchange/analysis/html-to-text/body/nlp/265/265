what
are
the
best
practice
for
checking
in
bin
directory
in
a
collaborative
development
environment
using
svn
?
should
project
level
reference
be
excluded
from
checkin
?
is
it
easier
to
just
add
all
bin
directory
?
i
develop
a
lot
of
dotnetnuke
site
and
it
seems
that
in
a
multi-developer
environment
,
it
's
always
a
huge
task
to
get
the
environment
setup
correctly.
the
ultimate
goal
(
of
course
)
is
to
have
a
new
developer
checkout
the
trunk
from
svn
,
restore
the
dnn
database
and
have
it
all
just
'work
'
