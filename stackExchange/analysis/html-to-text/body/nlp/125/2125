i
'm
trying
to
get
my
head
around
asp.net
mvc
coming
from
a
lamp
development
environment
.
this
is
n't
for
anything
production
or
mission-critical
,
just
a
guy
trying
to
learn
.
i
've
looked
at
all
i
can
on
http
:
//asp.net/mvc
but
a
lot
of
those
video
and
tutorial
seem
to
assume
you
know
asp.net
webforms
(
which
i
do
n't
)
although
i
am
quite
handy
with
vb.net
.
my
question
boil
down
to
,
doe
anyone
know
of
a
small
tutorial
or
even
have
one
they
made
themselves
whilst
exploring
asp.net
mvc
,
that
literally
just
show
you
how
to
create
,
read
,
update
and
delete
record
in
an
ms
sql
database
?
