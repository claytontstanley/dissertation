how
are
you
instrumenting
your
ui
's
?
in
the
past
i
've
read
that
people
have
instrumented
their
user
interface
,
but
what
i
have
n't
found
is
example
or
tip
on
how
to
instrument
a
ui
.
by
instrumenting
,
i
mean
collecting
data
regarding
usage
and
performance
of
the
system
.
a
msdn
article
on
instrumentation
is
http
:
//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x5952w0c.aspx
.
i
would
like
to
capture
which
button
user
click
on
,
what
keyboard
shortucts
they
use
,
what
term
they
use
to
search
,
etc
.
how
are
you
instrumenting
your
ui
?
what
format
are
you
storing
the
instrumentation
?
how
are
you
processing
the
instrumented
data
?
how
are
you
keeping
your
ui
code
clean
with
this
instrumentation
logic
?
specifically
,
i
am
implementing
my
ui
in
wpf
,
so
this
will
provide
extra
challenge
compared
to
instrumenting
a
web-based
application
.
(
i.e
.
need
to
transfer
the
instrumented
data
back
to
a
central
location
,
etc
)
.
that
said
,
i
feel
the
technology
may
provide
an
easier
implementation
of
instrumentation
via
concept
like
attached
property
.
have
you
instrumented
a
wpf
application
?
do
you
have
any
tip
on
how
this
can
be
achieved
?
