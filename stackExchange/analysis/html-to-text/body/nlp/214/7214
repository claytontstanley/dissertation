i
'm
currently
tasked
with
replacing
an
apache
+
resin
java
web
server
with
a
resin-only
configuration.
currently
in
our
apache
setup
,
we
use
.htaccess
and
a
small
user
database
to
provide
passwording
at
a
directory
level.
does
anyone
know
the
equivalent
setup
when
using
just
resin
a
the
web
server
?
