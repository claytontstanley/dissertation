i
currently
use
a
datatable
to
get
result
from
a
database
which
i
can
use
in
my
code.
however
,
many
example
on
the
web
show
using
a
dataset
instead
and
accessing
the
table
(
s
)
through
the
collection
method.
is
there
any
advantage
,
performance
wise
or
otherwise
,
of
using
datasets
or
datatables
a
a
storage
method
for
sql
result
?
