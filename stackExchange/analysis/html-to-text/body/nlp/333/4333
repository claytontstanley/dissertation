for
the
past
five
year
i
've
been
using
tdd
where
possible
and
i
feel
fairly
comfortable
and
confident
with
the
methodology.
i
already
know
what
mocking
framework
are
used
for
but
i
'd
like
to
learn
more
about
how
to
use
them.
does
anyone
have
a
list
of
link
to
good
example
of
using
mocking
framework
(
including
best
practice
,
anti-patterns
etc
)
in
a
real
world
business
app.
can
anyone
recommend
book
on
the
topic
?
any
step
by
step
tutorial
?
appreciated.
