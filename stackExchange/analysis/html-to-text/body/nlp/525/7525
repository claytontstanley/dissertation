so
,
i
need
some
help
.
i
am
working
on
a
project
in
c++
.
however
,
i
think
i
have
somehow
managed
to
corrupt
my
heap
.
this
is
based
off
the
fact
that
i
added
a
std
:
:string
to
a
class
and
assigning
it
a
value
from
another
std
:
:string
:
std
:
:string
hello
=
``
hello
,
world.\n
''
;
/*
examplestring
=
``
hello
,
world.\n
''
would
work
fine
.
*/
examplestring
=
hello
;
crash
on
my
system
with
a
stack
dump
.
so
basically
i
need
to
stop
and
go
through
all
my
code
and
memory
management
stuff
and
find
out
where
i
've
screwed
up
.
the
codebase
is
still
small
(
about
1000
line
)
,
so
this
is
easily
do-able
.
still
,
i
'm
over
my
head
with
this
kind
of
stuff
,
so
i
thought
i
'd
throw
it
out
there
.
i
'm
on
a
linux
system
,
and
have
poked
around
with
valgrind
,
and
while
not
knowing
completely
what
i
'm
doing
,
it
did
report
that
the
std
:
:string
's
destructor
wa
an
invalid
free
.
i
have
to
admit
to
getting
the
term
'heap
corruption
'
from
a
google
search
;
any
general
purpose
article
on
this
sort
of
stuff
would
be
appreciated
a
well
.
(
in
before
rm
-rf
projectdir
,
do
again
in
c
#
:
d
)
edit
:
i
have
n't
made
it
clear
,
but
what
i
'm
asking
for
are
way
an
advice
of
diagnosing
these
sort
of
memory
problem
.
i
know
the
std
:
:string
stuff
is
right
,
so
it
's
something
i
've
done
(
or
a
bug
,
but
there
's
not
a
problem
with
select
)
.
i
'm
sure
i
could
chuck
the
code
i
've
written
up
and
you
very
smart
folk
would
see
the
problem
in
no
time
,
but
i
want
to
add
this
kind
of
code
analysis
to
my
'toolbox
'
,
a
it
were
.
