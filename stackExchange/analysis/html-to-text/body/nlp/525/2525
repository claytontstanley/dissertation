my
product
is
both
asp.net
,
windows
form
app
and
windows
service
.
95
%
of
code
is
.net
(
vb
if
you
must
know
)
.
for
ip
reason
,
i
need
to
obfuscate
the
code
.
i
am
using
an
old
dotfuscator
(
over
5
year
old
)
and
thinking
it
is
time
to
move
to
a
new
gen
.
anyone
can
recommend
from
their
personal
experience
(
please
do
n't
just
give
me
a
list
of
vendor
,
i
already
have
that
)
what
work
best
for
them
?
taking
into
account
real
life
issue
like
:
dealing
with
the
old
problem
of
serialization/de-serialization
:
currently
,
i
simply
tell
the
tool
not
to
obfuscate
any
class
data
member
.
the
pain
of
not
being
able
to
load
data
that
wa
previously
serialized
with
an
old
version
is
just
to
big
integrating
the
tool
into
the
build
process
?
working
with
asp.net
which
is
a
story
since
depending
on
the
setting
,
you
do
n't
always
have
the
same
dll
name
(
and
you
have
lot
of
them
,
one
per
page
)
,
and
not
all
tool
handle
this
well
.
