to
analyze
lot
of
text
log
i
did
some
hackery
that
look
like
this
locally
import
log
into
access
reprocess
cube
link
to
previous
mdb
in
analisis
service
2000
(
yes
it
is
2k
)
use
excel
to
visualize
cube
(
it
is
not
big
-
up
to
milions
raw
entry
)
my
hackery
is
a
succes
and
more
people
are
demanding
an
access
to
my
tool
.
as
you
see
i
see
more
automating
and
easier
deployment
.
do
you
now
some
tools/libraries
that
would
give
me
the
same
but
with
easier
deployment
?
kind
of
embedded
olap
serwice
?
edit
:
i
heard
of
mondrian
but
we
do
n't
do
much
with
java
.
have
you
seen
something
similiar
done
for
.net/win32
?
comercial
