i
've
been
asked
to
join
in
with
a
project
and
there
is
no
actual
leader
(
it
's
not
a
business
setting
)
,
worse
still
there
are
about
8
member
and
because
of
this
,
there
is
no
actual
action
plan
.
i
'd
volunteer
myself
a
the
leader
or
manager
but
i
do
n't
have
the
time
or
inclination
to
do
so
,
should
i
just
watch
it
struggle
(
and
possibly
never
even
take
form
)
or
is
there
something
more
constructive
i
can
be
doing
?
