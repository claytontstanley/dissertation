i
have
a
little
game
written
in
c
#
.
it
us
a
database
a
back-end.
it
's
a
trading
card
game
,
and
i
wanted
to
implement
the
function
of
the
card
a
a
script.
what
i
mean
is
that
i
essentially
have
an
interface
,
icard
,
which
a
card
class
implement
(
public
class
card056
:
icard
)
and
which
contains
function
that
are
called
by
the
game.
now
,
to
make
the
thing
maintainable/moddable
,
i
would
like
to
have
the
class
for
each
card
a
source
code
in
the
database
and
essentially
compile
it
on
first
use.
so
when
i
have
to
add/change
a
card
,
i
'll
just
add
it
to
the
database
and
tell
my
application
to
refresh
,
without
needing
any
assembly
deployment
(
especially
since
we
would
be
talking
about
1
assembly
per
card
which
mean
hundred
of
assembly
)
.
is
that
possible
?
register
a
class
from
a
source
file
and
then
instantiate
it
,
etc.

=
new
mygame.cardlibrary.card056

(
ref

)
;
the
language
is
c
#
,
but
extra
bonus
if
it
's
possible
to
write
the
script
in
any
.net
language
.
