we
use
a
data
acquisition
card
to
take
reading
from
a
device
that
increase
it
signal
to
a
peak
and
then
fall
back
to
near
the
original
value
.
to
find
the
peak
value
we
currently
search
the
array
for
the
highest
reading
and
use
the
index
to
determine
the
timing
of
the
peak
value
which
is
used
in
our
calculation
.
this
work
well
if
the
highest
value
is
the
peak
we
are
looking
for
but
if
the
device
is
not
working
correctly
we
can
see
a
second
peak
which
can
be
higher
than
the
initial
peak
.
we
take
10
reading
a
second
from
16
device
over
a
90
second
period
.
my
initial
thought
are
to
cycle
through
the
reading
checking
to
see
if
the
previous
and
next
point
are
le
than
the
current
to
find
a
peak
and
construct
an
array
of
peak
.
maybe
we
should
be
looking
at
a
average
of
a
number
of
point
either
side
of
the
current
position
to
allow
for
noise
in
the
system
.
is
this
the
best
way
to
proceed
or
are
there
better
technique
?
