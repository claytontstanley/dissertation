i
've
noticed
a
lot
of
site
,
so
included
,
use
xhtml
a
their
mark-up
language
and
then
fail
to
adhere
to
the
spec
.
just
browsing
the
source
for
so
there
are
missing
closing
tag
for
paragraph
,
invalid
element
,
etc
.
so
should
tool
(
and
developer
)
use
the
xhtml
doctype
if
they
are
going
to
produce
invalid
mark
up
?
and
should
browser
be
more
firm
in
their
acceptance
of
poor
mark-up
?
and
before
anyone
shout
hypocrite
,
my
blog
ha
one
piece
of
invalid
mark-up
involving
the
captha
(
or
it
did
the
last
time
i
checked
)
which
involves
styling
the
noscript
tag
.
