the
version
of
subclipse
(
1.2.4
)
currently
available
through
aptana
's
automagic
plugins
manager
doe
not
work
with
the
newest
version
of
subversion
.
i
see
on
the
subclipse
website
however
that
they
have
1.4.2
out
for
eclipse
.
so
i
added
a
new
remote
update
site
:
http
:
//subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.4.x
to
my
update
manager
.
when
i
tried
to
install
it
,
it
told
me
i
needed
mylyn
3.0.0
.
so
i
after
much
searching
i
found
mylyn
3.0.0
and
added
another
new
remote
update
site
:
http
:
//download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/e3.3
to
my
update
manager
.
then
when
i
tried
to
install
that
,
it
told
me
i
needed
org.eclipse.ui
3.3.0
or
equivalent
.
looking
at
the
configuration
detail
for
aptana
,
it
look
like
it
is
built
against
eclipse
3.2.2
.
does
anyone
know
if
there
is
a
way
to
upgrade
the
version
of
eclipse
aptana
is
built
against
to
3.3.0
?
or
if
there
is
some
other
way
to
get
subclipse
to
work
with
the
very
newest
version
of
subversion
?
i
know
this
is
n't
necessarily
a
``
programming
''
question
,
but
i
hope
it
's
ok
since
it
's
highly
relevant
to
the
programming
experience
...
