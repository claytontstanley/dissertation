what
's
the
best
way
to
do
the
semantic
equivalent
of
the
traditional
sleep
(
)
system
call
from
within
an
informix
spl
routine
?
in
other
word
,
simply
``
pause
''
for
n
second
(
or
millisecond
or
whatever
,
but
second
are
fine
)
.
i
'm
looking
for
a
solution
that
doe
not
involve
linking
some
new
(
perhaps
written
by
me
)
c
code
or
other
library
into
the
informix
server.
this
ha
to
be
something
i
can
do
purely
from
spl.
a
solution
for
ids
10
or
11
would
be
fine.
@
ret
-
the
``
obvious
''
answer
wa
n't
obvious
to
me
!
i
did
n't
know
about
the
system
command.
thank
you
!
(
and
yes
,
i
'm
the
guy
you
think
i
am
.
