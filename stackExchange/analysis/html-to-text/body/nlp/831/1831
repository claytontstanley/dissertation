for
year
i
have
been
trying
to
find
an
organizational
scheme
which
work
for
me
.
i
've
tried
digital
calendar
(
google
calendar
,
my
webcal
at
work
,
chandler
,
sunbird
)
to
no
avail
a
of
yet
.
i
've
played
around
with
remember
the
milk
(
which
is
a
pretty
cool
app
in
and
of
itself
...
)
but
i
never
quite
got
in
the
groove
of
actually
using
it
and
checking
it
.
i
've
even
done
the
_**physical**_
calendar
thing
(
the
horror
)
.
maybe
the
best
scheme
i
've
found
(
which
during
the
summer
ha
gone
to
rot
)
is
a
wall
of
color-coded
sticky
note
...
organized
colorful
chaos
if
you
will
.
oh
i
do
get
thing
done
(
appointment
,
project
,
etc.
)
...
but
it
would
be
nice
to
actually
have
thing
layed
out
in
a
cleaner
fashion
.
then
i
would
n't
have
to
worry
so
much
about
if
i
've
forgotten
something
.
the
question
:
how
do
people
organize
their
life
,
their
work
,
their
software
project
?
do
you
use
software
,
some
physical
scheme
,
or
what
?
are
people
actually
organized
?
i
guess
the
tie-in
to
software
development
is
:
i
think
i
'd
have
more
brain
cycle
available
to
get
thing
coded
if
i
had
to
spend
le
keeping
everything
else
in
order
.
i
do
think
this
is
a
,
or
even
more
important
than
,
having
a
good
monitor
,
keyboard
,
and
chair
.
so
what
say
you
the
people
?
