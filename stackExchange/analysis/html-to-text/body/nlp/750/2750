i
'm
wondering
if
it
's
a
good
idea
to
make
verification
in
getters
and
setter
or
elsewhere
in
the
code.
this
might
surprise
you
be
when
it
come
to
optimization
and
speed-ing
up
the
code
,
i
think
you
should
not
made
verification
in
getters
and
setter
but
in
the
code
where
your
're
updating
your
file
or
database.
am
i
wrong
?
