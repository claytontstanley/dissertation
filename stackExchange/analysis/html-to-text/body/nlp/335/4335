is
there
anyway
to
configure
a
wcf
service
with
a
failover
endpoint
if
the
primary
endpoint
dy
?
kind
of
like
being
able
to
specify
a
failover
server
in
a
sql
cluster
...
specifically
i
am
using
the
tcp/ip
binding
for
speed
,
but
on
the
rare
occurrence
that
the
machine
is
not
available
i
would
like
to
redirect
traffic
to
the
failover
server.
not
too
bothered
about
losing
message
...
i
'd
just
prefer
not
to
write
the
code
to
handle
re-routing
!
cheers
,
