are
there
any
popular
and/or
public
website
that
utilize
the
javaserver
faces
framework
?
i
do
n't
ever
recall
stumbling
across
any
ever
on
the
internet.
in
my
experience
javaserver
faces
is
usually
reserved
for
non-public
enterprise
and
business
level
applications.
i
am
curious
to
know
because
i
am
researching
how
terrible
of
an
idea
it
would
be
to
construct
-
for
example
-
an
online
dating
website
utilizing
mvc
with
jsf
and
(
let
's
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
)
