i
need
to
grab
the
base64-encoded
representation
of
the
viewstate.
obviously
this
would
not
be
available
until
fairly
late
in
the
request
lifecycle
,
which
is
ok.
for
example
,
if
the
output
of
the
page
includes
:
<
input
type=
''
hidden
''
name=
''
__viewstate
''
id=
''
__viewstate
''
value=
''
/wepdwujodu0njc5md
...
==
''
/
>
i
need
a
way
on
the
server
side
to
get
the
value
``
/wepdwujodu0njc5md
...
==
''
to
clarify
,
i
need
this
value
when
the
page
is
being
rendered
,
not
on
postback.
e.g.
i
need
to
know
the
viewstate
value
that
is
being
sent
to
the
client
,
not
the
viewstate
i
'm
getting
back
from
them
.
