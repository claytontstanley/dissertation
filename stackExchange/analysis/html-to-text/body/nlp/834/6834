i
would
describe
myself
a
a
career
coder
-
i.e.
a
developer
at
work
but
never
really
coded
for
fun.
early
in
my
career
i
've
hit
the
management
track
though.
i
really
like
my
current
job
and
ca
n't
see
me
going
back
to
coding
anytime
soon
so
:
whats
the
best
way
to
develop
my
coding
skill
and
learn
new
language
in
my
spare
time
?
