i
'm
currently
working
on
an
internal
sale
application
for
the
company
i
work
for
,
and
i
've
got
a
form
that
allows
the
user
to
change
the
delivery
address.
now
i
think
it
would
look
much
nicer
,
if
the
textarea
i
'm
using
for
the
main
address
detail
would
just
take
up
the
area
of
the
text
in
it
,
and
automatically
resize
if
the
text
wa
changed.
here
's
a
screenshot
of
it
currently.
any
idea
?
