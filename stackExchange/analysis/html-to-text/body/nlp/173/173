i
've
been
wanting
to
get
my
database
under
version
control
.
does
anyone
have
any
advice
or
recommended
article
to
get
me
started
?
i
'll
always
want
to
have
at
least
some
data
in
there
(
a
alumb
mention
:
user
type
and
administrator
)
.
and
i
'll
probably
often
want
a
large
collection
of
generated
test
data
for
performance
measurement
.
