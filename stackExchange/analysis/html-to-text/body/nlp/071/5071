i
've
played
with
cvs
a
little
bit
and
am
not
the
most
familiar
with
all
of
it
capability
,
but
a
huge
annoyance
for
me
is
trying
to
add
new
directory
that
contain
more
directory
in
them
.
running
``
cv
add
''
only
add
the
content
of
the
current
directory
,
and
using
``
cv
import
''
did
n't
look
like
the
right
thing
either
since
it
's
still
all
code
i
'm
producing
(
this
howto
claimed
import
is
for
3rd
party
source
)
do
you
guy
know
any
way
to
recursively
add
everything
in
a
given
directory
to
the
current
cvs
project
(
or
if
svn
or
git
make
this
notably
easier
)
?
