i
'm
setting
up
replication
for
a
server
which
run
a
bunch
of
database
(
one
per
client
)
and
plan
on
adding
more
all
the
time
,
on
my.cnf
,
instead
of
having
:
binlog-do-db
=
databasename
1
binlog-do-db
=
databasename
2
binlog-do-db
=
databasename
3
...
binlog-do-db
=
databasename
n
can
i
rather
just
have
binlog-ignore-db
=
mysql
binlog-ignore-db
=
informationschema
(
and
no
database
to
log
specified
)
and
assume
that
everything
else
is
logged
?
edit
:
thanks
!
actually
if
i
remove
all
my
binlog-do-db
entry
,
it
seemingly
log
everything
(
a
you
see
the
binary
log
file
change
position
when
you
move
the
database
)
,
but
on
the
slave
server
,
nothing
get
picked
up
!
(
perhaps
,
this
is
the
case
to
use
replicate-do-db
?
this
would
kill
the
idea
;
i
guess
i
cant
have
mysql
automagically
detect
which
database
to
replicate
)
.
