}
the
connect.php
file
contains
my
mysql
connect
call
that
are
working
fine
with
my
insert
query
in
another
portion
of
the
software
.
if
i
comment
out
the
$
result
=
mysql_query
line
,
then
it
go
through
to
the
else
statement
.
so
,
it
is
that
line
or
the
content
in
the
if
.
i
have
been
searching
the
net
for
any
solution
,
and
most
seem
to
be
related
to
too
many
mysql
connection
or
that
the
user
i
am
logging
into
mysql
a
doe
not
have
permission
.
i
have
checked
both
.
i
can
still
perform
my
other
query
elsewhere
in
the
software
,
and
i
have
verified
that
the
account
ha
the
correct
permission
.
i
think
i
just
need
an
outside
perspective
a
i
have
been
staring
at
this
little
block
of
code
all
day
.
if
any
more
information
is
needed
,
just
let
me
know
.
