what
is
the
``
purist
''
or
``
correct
''
way
to
access
an
object
's
property
from
within
an
object
method
that
is
not
a
getter/setter
method
?
i
know
that
from
outside
of
the
object
you
should
use
a
getter/setter
,
but
from
within
would
you
just
do
:
java
:
string
property
=
this.property
;
php
:
$
property
=
$
this-
>
property
;
or
would
you
do
:
java
:
string
property
=
this.getproperty
(
)
;
php
:
$
property
=
$
this-
>
getproperty
(
)
;
forgive
me
if
my
java
is
a
little
off
,
it
's
been
a
year
since
i
programmed
in
java
...
edit
:
it
seems
people
are
assuming
i
am
talking
about
private
or
protected
variables/properties
only.
when
i
learned
oo
i
wa
taught
to
use
getters/setters
for
every
single
property
even
if
it
wa
public
(
and
actually
i
wa
told
never
to
make
any
variable/property
public
)
.
so
,
i
may
be
starting
off
from
a
false
assumption
from
the
get
go.
it
appears
that
people
answering
this
question
are
maybe
saying
that
you
should
have
public
property
and
that
those
do
n't
need
getters
and
setter
,
which
go
against
what
i
wa
taught
,
and
what
i
wa
talking
about
,
although
maybe
that
need
to
be
discussed
a
well.
that
's
probably
a
good
topic
for
a
different
question
though
