i
learned
swing
back
in
the
day
but
now
i
've
moved
to
python
and
want
to
make
some
apps
with
guis
.
i
have
n't
had
the
time
to
learn
a
new
gui
api
so
i
've
been
using
jython
,
but
i
would
prefer
to
use
cpython
.
it
would
be
great
if
i
can
have
one
simple
markup
that
allows
me
to
switch
gui
library
.
it
would
be
even
better
if
i
can
use
the
same
markup
language
across
language
so
i
can
quickly
make
guis
for
any
language
i
'm
using
.
does
anyone
know
of
such
a
markup/library
?
i
've
seen
markup
like
glade
and
wxwidget
's
markup
(
i
forget
the
name
)
.
they
're
partly
what
i
'm
looking
for
(
making
a
gui
without
coding
it
in
a
language
)
but
they
're
intertwined
with
a
specific
library
.
and
neither
are
really
nice
looking
or
friendly
to
human
editting
.
