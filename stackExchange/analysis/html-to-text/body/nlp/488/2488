i
'm
tired
of
opening
dia
and
creating
a
database
diagram
at
the
beginning
of
every
project
.
is
there
a
tool
out
there
that
will
let
me
select
specific
table
and
then
create
a
database
diagram
for
me
based
on
a
mysql
database
?
preferably
it
would
allow
me
to
edit
the
diagram
afterward
since
none
of
the
foreign
key
are
set
...
here
is
what
i
am
picturing
diagram-wise
(
please
excuse
the
horrible
data
design
,
i
did
n't
design
it
.
let
's
focus
on
the
diagram
concept
and
not
on
the
actual
data
it
represents
for
this
example
;
