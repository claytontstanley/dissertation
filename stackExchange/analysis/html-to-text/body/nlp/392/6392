i
am
running
a
tomcat
application
,
and
i
need
to
display
some
time
value
.
unfortunately
,
the
time
is
coming
up
an
hour
off
.
i
looked
into
it
and
discovered
that
my
default
timezone
is
being
set
to
:
sun.util.calendar.zoneinfo
[
id=
''
gmt-08:00
''
,
offset=-28800000
,
dstsavings=0
,
usedaylight=false
,
transitions=0
,
lastrule=null
]
rather
than
the
pacific
time
zone
.
this
is
further
indicated
when
i
try
to
print
the
default
time
zone
's
display
name
,
and
it
come
up
``
gmt-08:00
''
,
which
seems
to
indicate
to
me
that
it
is
not
correctly
set
to
the
us
pacific
time
zone
.
i
am
running
on
ubuntu
hardy
heron
,
upgraded
from
gutsy
gibbon
.
is
there
a
configuration
file
i
can
update
to
tell
the
jre
to
use
pacific
with
all
the
associated
daylight
saving
time
information
?
the
time
on
my
machine
show
correctly
,
so
it
doe
n't
seem
to
be
an
os-wide
misconfiguration
.
ok
,
here
's
an
update
.
a
coworker
suggested
i
update
java_opts
in
my
/etc/profile
to
include
``
-duser.timezone=us/pacific
''
,
which
worked
(
i
also
saw
catalina_opts
,
which
i
updated
a
well
)
.
actually
,
i
just
exported
the
change
into
the
variable
rather
than
use
the
new
/etc/profile
(
a
reboot
later
will
pick
up
the
change
and
i
will
be
golden
)
.
however
,
i
still
think
there
is
a
better
solution
...
there
should
be
a
configuration
for
java
somewhere
that
say
what
timezone
it
is
using
,
or
how
it
is
grabbing
the
timezone
.
if
someone
know
such
a
setting
,
that
would
be
awesome
,
but
for
now
this
is
a
decent
workaround
.
