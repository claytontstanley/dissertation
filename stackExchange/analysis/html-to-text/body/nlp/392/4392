in
the
past
few
month
i
began
my
first
serious
javascript
development
,
a
i
began
developing
xul
applications.
i
use
notepad++
a
my
editor
,
but
i
wa
pretty
appalled
to
find
(
a
far
a
i
can
tell
)
that
venkman/javascript
debugger
is
the
tool
for
debugging.
it
seems
like
a
poor
replacement
to
visual
studio
for
.net
languages.
am
i
missing
something
?
what
are
the
best
tool
and
best
practice
for
javascript
development
?
is
there
some
killer
ide/debugger/editor
combination
i
'm
not
aware
of
?
it
ha
to
be
easier
than
this
,
though.
i
've
heard
some
mention
of
eclipse
-
is
it
a
good
choice
here
?
i
know
very
little
about
it.
edit
:
some
of
you
have
pointed
out
firebug
-
i
guess
my
problem
wa
that
i
'm
not
actually
using
javascript
for
web
development
for
which
firebug
seems
to
be
the
tool
--
instead
i
'm
using
it
for
xul
development
in
xulrunner.
which
may
simply
be
a
weakness
or
immaturity
of
xulrunner
.
