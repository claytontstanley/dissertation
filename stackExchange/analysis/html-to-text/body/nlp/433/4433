i
am
about
to
get
a
new
pc
from
work
,
and
it
will
include
the
option
to
have
either
vista
business
a
the
os
,
or
a
downgrade
to
xp
pro
.
aside
from
a
tiny
bit
of
testing
,
i
have
never
used
vista
,
but
overall
i
have
heard
many
more
bad
report
than
good
regarding
vista
.
i
do
n't
think
that
hardware
will
be
an
issue
(
intel
core
duo
t9300
,
4gb
ram
,
256mb
nvidia
)
in
term
of
performance
.
i
am
just
uneasy
about
using
vista
for
my
main
dev
system
given
it
history
,
when
i
have
the
opportunity
to
keep
on
using
xp
.
so
is
there
anyone
here
who
ha
experience
with
both
vista
and
xp
a
the
os
on
your
dev
machine
?
if
you
could
choose
one
over
the
other
,
which
would
you
go
with
?
i
will
need
to
use
visual
studio
2003/2005/2008
,
sql
server
2005
,
virtual
machines
,
office
,
a
well
a
lot
of
multi-tasking
and
multi-tab
web
browsing
.
(
note
:
i
am
not
interested
in
microsoft-bashing
.
if
you
have
n't
used
vista
but
have
just
heard
bad
thing
about
it
then
you
have
the
same
level
of
experience
a
me
and
you
probably
should
n't
be
answering
the
question
)
.
edit
:
as
i
am
getting
this
computer
from
work
i
would
prefer
to
use
one
of
the
operating
system
offered
:
32
bit
xp
pro
or
32
bit
vista
.
