is
there
a
good
way
for
displaying
unicode
text
in
opengl
under
windows
?
for
example
,
when
you
have
to
deal
with
different
language
.
the
most
common
approach
like
#
define
fontlistrange
128
gluint
list
;
list
=
glgenlists
(
fontlistrange
)
;
wglusefontbitmapsw
(
hdc
,
0
,
fontlistrange
,
list
)
;
just
wo
n't
do
because
you
ca
n't
create
enough
list
for
all
unicode
character
.
