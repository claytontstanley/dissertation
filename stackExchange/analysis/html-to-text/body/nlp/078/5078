i
'd
like
to
set
up
a
cheap
linux
box
a
a
web
server
to
host
a
variety
of
web
technology
(
php
&
java
ee
come
to
mind
,
but
i
'd
like
to
experiment
with
ruby
or
python
in
the
future
a
well
)
.
i
'm
fairly
versed
in
setting
up
tomcat
to
run
on
linux
for
serving
up
java
ee
application
,
but
i
'd
like
to
be
able
to
open
this
server
up
,
even
just
so
i
can
create
some
tool
i
can
use
while
i
am
working
in
the
office
.
all
the
experience
i
've
had
with
configuring
java
ee
site
ha
all
been
for
intranet
application
where
we
were
told
not
to
focus
on
securing
the
page
for
external
user
.
what
is
your
advice
on
setting
up
a
personal
linux
web
server
in
a
secure
enough
way
to
open
it
up
for
external
traffic
?
