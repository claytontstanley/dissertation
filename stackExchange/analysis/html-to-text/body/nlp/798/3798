currently
i
have
two
linux
server
running
mysql
,
one
sitting
on
a
rack
right
next
to
me
under
a
10
mbit/s
upload
pipe
(
main
server
)
and
another
some
couple
of
mile
away
on
a
3
mbit/s
upload
pipe
(
mirror
)
.
i
want
to
be
able
to
replicate
data
on
both
server
continuously
,
but
have
run
into
several
roadblock
.
one
of
them
being
,
under
mysql
master/slave
configuration
,
every
now
and
then
,
some
statement
drop
(
!
)
,
meaning
;
some
people
logging
on
to
the
mirror
url
do
n't
see
data
that
i
know
is
on
the
main
server
and
vice
versa
.
let
's
say
this
happens
on
a
meaningful
block
of
data
once
every
month
,
so
i
can
live
with
it
and
assume
it
's
a
``
lost
packet
''
issue
(
i.e.
,
god
know
,
but
we
'll
compensate
)
.
the
other
most
important
(
and
annoying
)
recurring
issue
is
that
,
when
for
some
reason
we
do
a
major
upload
or
update
(
or
reboot
)
on
one
end
and
have
to
sever
the
link
,
then
load
data
from
master
doe
n't
work
and
i
have
to
manually
dump
on
one
end
and
upload
on
the
other
,
quite
a
task
nowadays
moving
some
.5
tb
worth
of
data
.
is
there
software
for
this
?
i
know
mysql
(
the
``
corporation
''
)
offer
this
a
a
very
expensive
service
(
full
database
replication
)
.
i
am
just
wondering
what
people
out
there
do
.
the
way
it
's
structured
,
we
run
an
automatic
failover
where
if
one
server
is
not
up
,
then
the
main
url
just
resolve
to
the
other
server
.
