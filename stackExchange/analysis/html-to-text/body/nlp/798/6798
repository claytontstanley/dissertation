when
making
the
step
from
developer
to
management
how
far
away
from
the
code
should
you
get
?
the
standard
advice
is
'stop
coding
'
but
rands
had
an
interesting
blog
post
about
how
it
important
to
keep
coding.

in
my
experience
(
working
for
a
big
telecomms
company
)
it
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
keep
coding
.
