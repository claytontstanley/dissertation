whenever
i
design
a
database
,
i
always
wonder
if
there
is
a
best
way
of
naming
an
item
in
my
database
.
quite
often
i
ask
myself
the
following
question
:
should
table
name
be
plural
?
should
column
name
be
singular
?
should
i
prefix
table
or
column
?
should
i
use
any
case
in
naming
item
?
are
there
any
recommended
guideline
out
there
for
naming
item
in
a
database
?
