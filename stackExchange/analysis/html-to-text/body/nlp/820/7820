can
anyone
suggest
a
good
guide/tutorial
for
programming
postgresql
?
by
this
i
mean
creating
trigger
and
procedure
,
domain
,
new
type
,
using
the
various
language
,
and
so
on.
the
manual
is
good
,
but
i
found
it
lacking
a
a
learning
aid
(
it
is
more
of
a
reference
,
a
manual
should
be
)
?
it
is
very
good
at
describing
the
sql
syntax
and
administration
tool
,
but
wa
not
very
good
at
the
more
advanced
feature
of
postgresql.
i
have
used
the
forum
in
the
past
http
:
//www.postgresqlforums.com/forums/
but
i
think
a
proper
guide
or
tutorial
would
be
better.
edit
:
rereading
my
question
,
i
see
i
wa
not
clear
enough
,
i
am
asking
about
writing
stored
procedures/triggers
,
creating
new
domain
and
type
and
all
the
higher
end
stuff.
i
wa
not
asking
about
basic
sql
and
database
function
,
i
wa
thinking
more
along
the
power
user
lines.
update
(
dec
2008
)
:
i
still
have
not
had
a
whole
lot
of
luck
finding
anything
really.
i
am
currently
using
the
later
chapter
of
the
postgresql
manual.
in
the
floss
weekly
episode
on
postgresql
,
josh
berkus
spoke
of
various
us
where
people
have
found
way
for
their
server
to
talk
directly
to
other
database
,
and
various
other
application
that
really
sound
quite
impressive.
of
course
,
it
seems
quite
plausible
that
this
kind
of
functionality
just
is
not
really
documented
anywhere
.
