i
use
firebug
and
the
mozilla
js
console
like
crazy
,
but
every
now
and
then
run
into
an
ie-only
javascript
bug
,
which
everyone
know
are
really
hard
to
locate
even
though
you
know
theyre
there
(
ex
:
error
on
line
724
,
when
your
source
html
only
ha
200
line
!
)
i
would
love
to
have
a
lightweight
js
tool
(
a
la
firebug
)
for
ie
,
something
i
can
install
in
second
on
a
client
pc
if
i
run
into
an
error
and
then
uninstall
.
some
microsoft
tool
take
some
serious
download
and
configuration
time
.
idea
?
cheers
