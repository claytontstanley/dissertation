i
have
a
quad
core
machine
and
would
like
to
write
some
code
to
parse
a
text
file
that
take
advantage
of
all
four
core
.
the
text
file
basically
contains
one
record
per
line
.
multithreading
is
n't
my
forte
so
i
'm
wondering
if
anyone
could
give
me
some
pattern
that
i
might
be
able
to
use
to
parse
the
file
in
an
optimal
manner
.
my
first
thought
are
to
read
all
the
line
into
some
sort
of
queue
and
then
spin
up
thread
to
pull
the
line
off
the
queue
and
process
them
,
but
that
mean
the
queue
would
have
to
exist
in
memory
and
these
are
faily
large
file
so
i
'm
not
so
keen
on
that
idea
.
my
next
thought
are
to
have
some
sort
of
controller
that
will
read
in
a
line
and
assign
it
a
thread
to
parse
,
but
i
'm
not
sure
if
the
controller
will
end
up
being
a
bottleneck
if
the
thread
are
processing
the
line
faster
than
it
can
read
and
assign
them
.
i
know
there
's
probably
another
simpler
solution
than
both
of
these
but
at
the
moment
i
'm
just
not
seeing
it
.
