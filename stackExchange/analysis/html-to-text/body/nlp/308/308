i
often
run
into
the
following
problem.
i
work
on
some
change
to
a
project
that
require
new
table
or
column
in
the
database.
i
make
the
database
modification
and
continue
my
work.
usually
,
i
remember
to
write
down
the
change
so
that
they
can
be
replicated
on
the
live
system.
however
,
i
do
n't
always
remember
what
i
've
changed
and
i
do
n't
always
remember
to
write
it
down.
so
,
i
make
a
push
to
the
live
system
and
get
a
big
,
obvious
error
that
there
is
no
newcolumnx.
ugh.
regardless
of
the
fact
that
this
may
not
be
the
best
practice
for
this
situation
,
is
there
a
version
control
system
for
database
?
i
do
n't
care
about
the
specific
database
technology.
i
just
want
to
know
if
one
exists.
if
it
happens
to
work
with
ms
sql
server
,
then
great
.
