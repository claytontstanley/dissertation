i
've
been
banging
my
head
against
sql
server
2005
trying
to
get
a
lot
of
data
out.
i
've
been
given
a
database
with
nearly
300
table
in
it
and
i
need
to
turn
this
into
a
mysql
database.
my
first
call
wa
to
use
bcp
but
unfortunately
it
doe
n't
produce
valid
csv
-
string
are
n't
encapsulated
so
you
ca
n't
deal
with
any
row
that
ha
a
string
with
a
comma
in
it
(
or
whatever
you
use
a
a
delimiter
)
and
i
would
still
have
to
hand
write
all
of
the
create
table
statement
a
obviously
csv
doe
n't
tell
you
anything
about
the
data
types.
what
would
be
better
is
if
there
wa
some
tool
that
could
connect
to
both
sql
server
and
mysql
and
then
do
a
copy.
you
lose
view
,
stored
procedure
,
trigger
,
etc.
but
it
is
n't
hard
to
copy
a
table
that
only
us
base
type
from
one
db
to
another
...
is
it
?
does
anybody
know
of
such
a
tool
?
i
do
n't
mind
how
many
assumption
it
make
or
what
simplification
occur
,
a
long
a
it
support
integer
,
float
,
datetime
and
string.
i
have
to
do
a
lot
of
pruning
,
normalising
,
etc.
anyway
so
i
do
n't
care
about
keeping
key
,
relationship
or
anything
like
that
but
i
need
the
initial
set
of
data
in
fast
!
