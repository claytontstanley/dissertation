here
on
stack
overflow
,
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
use
the
tab
key
within
the
wmd
editor
text
box
to
tab
over
4
space
.
the
way

is
now
,
the
tab

to
the
tags
.
vote
for
this
feature
at
uservoice
:
http

is
there
some
javascript
that
will
capture
the
tab
key
in
the
text
box
before
it
bubble
up
to
the
ui
?
i
understand
some
browser
(
i.e
.
firefox
)
may
not
allow
this
.
how
about
a
custom
key-combo
like
shift-tab
,
or
ctrl-q
?
