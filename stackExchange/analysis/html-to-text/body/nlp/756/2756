even
though
i
have
a
robust
and
fast
computer
(
pentium
dual
core
2.0
with
2gb
ram
)
,
i
'm
always
searching
for
lightweight
software
to
have
on
it
,
so
it
run
fast
even
when
many
apps
are
up
and
running
simultaneously.
on
the
last
few
week
i
've
been
migrating
gradually
to
linux
and
want
to
install
a
free
lightweight
yet
useful
ide
to
program
on
c++
and
php.
sintax
highlighting
and
code
completition
tip
are
must-haves.
so
,
i
'd
like
to
receive
some
suggestion
from
you
,
guy
.
