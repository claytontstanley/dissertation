how
can
i
monitor
a
mssql
database
for
change
to
a
table
without
using
trigger
or
modifying
the
structure
of
the
database
in
any
way
?
my
preferred
programming
environment
is
.net
and
c
#

)
i
'd
like
to
support
ms
sql
2000
sp4
or
higher
by
``
change
to
a
table
''
i
mean
change
to
table
data
,
not
change
to
table
structure.
ultimately
,
i
would
like
the
change
to
trigger
an
event
in
my
application
,
instead
of
having
to
check
for
change
at
an
interval
.
