my
company
make
a
monolithic
piece
of
software
that
our
customer
use
to
run
their
car
dealerships.
the
original
app
wa
written
in
vb6
,
and
it
ha
grown
substantially
over
the
last
few
years.
until
now
,
there
ha
n't
really
been
a
business
case
for
switching
to
the
.net
framework.
sure
,
it
's
newer
,
considerably
better
at
certain
thing
,
and
when
used
correctly
speed
development
time
,
but
there
's
nothing
we
ca
n't
do
in
vb6
that
we
need
to
be
able
to
do.
getting
thing
done
is
harder
in
vb6
,
but
almost
nothing
is
impossible.
recently
though
,
microsoft
dropped
support
for
vb6
,
and
it
seems
obvious
to
me
that
switching
to
a
new
platform
is
inevitable.
the
way
vb
.net
work
and
requires
you
to
think
is
so
fundamentally
different
(
heck
,
even
the
way
you
pas
variable
into
sub
ha
changed
)
,
and
a
far
a
i
can
tell
,
switching
to
.net
would
require
a
complete
re-design
and
re-write
of
the
app.
my
question
(
s
)
:
have
any
of
you
been
in
this
position
?
of
the
tool
available
to
smooth
the
transition
,
which
one
work
and
which
should
be
avoided
?
and
how
do
i
sell
our
customer
and
my
bos
on
this
?
as
the
suit
like
to
say
,
where
's
the
roi
?
