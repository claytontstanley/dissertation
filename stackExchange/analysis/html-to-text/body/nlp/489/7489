i
've
made
many
different
seperate
part
of
a
gui
system
for
the
nintendo
ds
,
like
button
and
textboxes
and
select
box
,
but
i
need
a
way
of
containing
these
class
in
one
gui
class
,
so
that
i
can
draw
everything
to
the
screen
all
at
once
,
and
check
all
the
button
at
once
to
check
if
any
are
being
pressed.
my
question
is
what
is
the
best
way
organize
all
the
class
(
such
a
button
and
textboxes
)
into
one
gui
class
?
here
's
one
way
i
thought
of
but
it
doe
n't
seem
right
:
edit
:
i
'm
using
c++.
class
gui
{
public
:
void
update_all
(
)
;
void
draw_all
(
)
const
;
int
add_button
(
button
*button
)
;
//
returns
button
id
void
remove_button
(
int
button_id
)
;
private
:
button
*buttons
[
10
]
;
int
num_buttons
;
}
this
code
ha
a
few
problem
,
but
i
just
wanted
to
give
you
an
idea
of
what
i
want
.
