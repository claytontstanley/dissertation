this
is
how
i
wanted
to
do
it
which
would
work
in
php
5.3.0+
<
?
php
class
myclass
{
const
constant
=
'const
var
'
;
}
$
classname
=
'myclass
'
;
echo
$
classname
:
:constant
;
//
as
of
php
5.3.0
?
>
but
i
'm
restricted
to
using
php
5.2.6
.
can
anyone
think
of
a
simple
way
to
simulate
this
behaviour
without
instantiating
the
class
?
