lately
i
've
been
thinking
a
lot
about
the
best
way
to
enter
an
existing
project
fast
.
i
've
written
some
of
my
thought
here
,
and
would
really
like
to
hear
advice
from
other
people
.
what
are
the
thing
you
find
a
must
?
i
'm
especially
interested
with
open
source
project
,
if
there
's
any
difference
.
