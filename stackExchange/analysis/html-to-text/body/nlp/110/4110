i
've
been
tasked
with
redesigning
part
of
a
ms-sql
database
structure
which
currently
involves
a
lot
of
view
,
some
of
which
contain
join
to
other
view
.
anyway
,
i
wonder
if
anyone
here
could
recommend
a
utility
to
automatically
generate
diagram
to
help
me
visualise
the
whole
structure
.
what
's
the
best
program
you
've
used
for
such
problem
?
