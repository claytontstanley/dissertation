what
is
the
best
way
to
transcode
audio
and
video
to
show
on
the
web
?
i
need
to
do
it
programmatically.
i
'd
like
to
do
something
like
youtube
or
google
video
where
user
can
upload
whatever
format
they
want
,
and
i
encode
it
to
flv
,
mp3
,
and/or
mp4.
i
could
do
it
on
our
server
,
but
i
would
rather
use
an
ec2
instance
or
even
a
web
service.
we
have
a
windows
2008
server
.
