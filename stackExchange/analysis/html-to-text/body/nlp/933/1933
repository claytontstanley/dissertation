i
have
had
horrible
procrastination
habit
since
gradeschool
,
and
now
that
i
'm
in
college
,
i
still
am
having
a
hard
time
beating
this
bad
habit
.
i
find
myself
easily
distracted
from
doing
real
``
work
''
and
find
myself
wandering
off
doing
something
else
that
i
enjoy
more
.
tell
me
how
you
personally
beat
procrastination
;
or

your
struggle
