i
'm
looking
for
idea
on
how
to
draw
a
skinnable
``
button
''
in
a
game
application
.
if
i
use
a
fixed
sprite
non-vector
image
for
the
button
background
,
then
i
ca
n't
size
the
button
easily
.
if
i
write
code
to
draw
a
resizable
button
(
like
windows
button
are
drawn
)
,
then
the
programmer
ha
to
get
involved
--
and
it
make
skinning
difficult
.
another
option
is
to
break
the
button
into
9
smaller
image
(
3x3
)
and
stretch
them
all
--
kindof
like
rounded
corner
are
done
in
html
.
is
there
another
``
easier
''
way
?
what
's
the
best
approach
?
