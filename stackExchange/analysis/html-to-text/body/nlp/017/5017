i
have
written
an
air
application
that
downloads
video
and
document
from
a
server
.
the
video
play
inside
of
the
application
,
but
i
would
like
the
user
to
be
able
to
open
the
document
in
their
native
application
.
i
am
looking
for
a
way
to
prompt
the
user
to
open
/
save
as
on
a
local
file
stored
in
the
application
storage
directory
.
i
have
tried
using
the
filereference
+
urlrequest
class
but
this
throw
an
exception
that
it
need
a
remote
url
.
my
last
resort
is
just
copying
the
file
to
their
desktop
:
