hi
.
i
am
a
css
newbie
trying
to
layout
a
table-like
page
with
two
column
.
i
want
the
rightmost
column
to
dock
to
the
right
of
the
page
,
and
this
column
should
have
a
distinct
background
color
.
the
content
in
the
right
side
is
almost
always
going
to
be
smaller
than
that
on
the
left
.
i
would
like
the
div
on
the
right
to
always
be
tall
enough
to
reach
the
separator
for
the
row
below
it
.
how
can
i
make
my
background
color
fill
that
space
?
<
html
>
<
body
>
<
style
type=
''
text/css
''
>
.rightfloat
{
color
:
red
;
background-color
:
#
bbbbbb
;
float
:
right
;
width
:
200px
;
}
.left
{
font-size
:
20pt
;
}
.separator
{
clear
:
both
;
width
:
100
%
;
border-top
:
1px
solid
black
;
}
<
/style
>
<
div
class=
''
separator
''
>
<
div
class=
''
rightfloat
''
>
some
really
short
content
.
<
/div

<
div
class=

some
really

really
really
really
really
really
really
big
content

some
more

edit
:
i
agree
that
this
example
is
very
table-like
and
an
actual
table
would
be
a
fine
choice
.
but
my
``
real
''
page
will
eventually
be
le
table-like
,
and
i
'd
just
like
to
first
master
this
task
!
also
,
for
some
reason
,
when
i
create/edit
my
post
in
ie7
,
the
code
show
up
correctly
in
the
preview
view
,
but
when
i
actually
post
the
message
,
the
formatting
get
removed
.
editing
my
post
in
firefox
2
seems
to
have
worked
,
fwiw
.
another
edit
:
yeah
,
i
unaccepted
gatekiller
's
answer
.
it
doe
indeed
work
nicely
on
my
simple
page
,
but
not
in
my
actual
heavier
page
.
i
'll
investigate
some
of
the
link
y'all
have
pointed
me
to
.
thanks
!
