when
attempting
to
compile
my
c
#
project
,
i
get
the
following
error
:
'c
:
\documents
and
settings\dan\desktop\rowdy
pixel\apps\cleanermenu\cleanermenu\obj\debug\csc97.tmp
'
is
not
a
valid
win32
resource
file.
having
gone
through
many
google
search
,
i
have
determined
that
this
is
usually
caused
by
a
256x256
image
inside
an
icon
used
by
the
project.
i
've
gone
through
all
the
icon
and
removed
the
256x256
version
,
but
the
error
persists.
any
idea
on
how
to
get
rid
of
this
?
