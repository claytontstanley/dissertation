i
'd
like
to
create
a
progress
bar
to
indicate
the
status
of
an
a
batch
job
in
ruby.
i
've
read
some
tutorial
/
library
on
using
ncurses
,
none
of
which
were
particularly
helpful
in
explaining
how
create
an
``
animated
''
progress
bar
in
the
terminal
or
using
curse
with
ruby.
i
'm
already
aware
of
using
a
separate
thread
to
monitor
the
progress
of
a
given
job
,
i
'm
just
not
sure
how
to
proceed
with
drawing
a
progress
bar.
update
progressbar
class
wa
incredibly
straight-forward
,
perfectly
solved
my
problem
.
