hi
everyone
,
i
am
working
on
a
project
that
requires
the
manipulation
of
enourmous
matrix
,
particularly
pyramidal
summation
for
a
copula
calculation.
in
short
,
i
need
to
keep
track
of
a
relatively
small
number
of
value
(
usually
a
value
of
1
,
and
in
rare
case
more
than
1
)
in
a
sea
of
zero
in
the
matrix
(
multidimensional
array
)
.
a
sparse
array
allows
the
user
to
store
a
small
number
of
value
,
and
assume
all
undefined
record
to
be
a
preset
value.
since
is
is
not
physically
possibly
to
store
all
value
in
memory
(
greater
in
number
than
the
number
of
particle
in
the
universe
:
p
)
,
i
need
to
store
only
the
few
non-zero
elements.
this
could
be
several
million
entries.
i
am
currently
working
on
a
system
that
us
a
binary
search
tree
(
b-tree
)
to
store
entries.
does
anyone
know
of
a
better
system
?
thanks
in
advance.
edit
:
speed
is
a
huge
priority.
edit2
:
i
like
that
solution.
how
would
i
go
about
dynamically
choosing
the
number
of
variable
in
the
class
at
runtime
?
