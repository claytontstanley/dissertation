i
'm
downloading
a
web
page
(
tag
soup
html
)
with
xmlhttprequest
and
i
want
to
take
the
output
and
turn
it
into
a
dom
object
that
i
can
then
run
xpath
query
on
.
how
do
i
convert
from
a
string
into
dom
object
?
it
appears
that
the
general
solution
is
to
create
a
hidden
iframe
and
throw
the
content
of
the
string
into
that
.
there
ha
been
talk
of
updating
domparser
to
support
text/html
but
a
of
firefox
3.0.1
you
still
get
an
ns_error_not_implemented
if
you
try
.
is
there
any
option
besides
using
the
hidden
iframe
trick
?
and
if
not
,
what
is
the
best
way
to
do
the
iframe
trick
so
that
your
code
work
outside
the
context
of
any
currently
open
tab
(
so
that
closing
tab
wo
n't
screw
up
code
,
etc
)
?
this
is
an
example
of
why
i
'm
looking
for
a
solution
other
than
the
iframe
hack
,
if
i
have
to
write
all
that
code
to
have
a
robust
solution
,
then
i
'd
rather
keep
looking
for
something
else
.
