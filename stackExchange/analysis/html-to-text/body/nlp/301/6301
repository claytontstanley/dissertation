why
is
array.length
an
int
,
and
not
an
uint.
this
bother
me
(
just
a
bit
)
,
because
a
length
value
can
never
by
negative.
this
also
forced
me
to
use
an
int
for
a
length-property
on
my
own
class
,
because
when
you
specify
an
int-value
,
this
need
to
be
cast
explicity
...
so
the
ultimate
question
is
:
is
there
any
use
for
an
unsigned
int
(
uint
)
?
even
microsoft
seems
not
to
use
them
.
