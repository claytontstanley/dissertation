as
a
long
time
world
of
warcraft
player
,
and
a
passionate
developer
i
have
decided
that
i
would
like
to
combine
the
two
and
set
about
developing
some
addins.
not
only
to
improve
my
gameplay
experience
but
a
a
great
opportunity
to
learn
something
new.
does
anyone
have
any
advice
on
how
to
go
about
starting
out
?
is
there
an
ide
one
can
use
?
how
doe
one
go
about
testing
?
are
there
any
ready
made
library
available
?
or
would
i
get
a
better
learning
experience
by
ignoring
the
library
and
building
from
scratch
?
how
do
i
oneshot
hogger
?
would
love
to
hear
your
advice
,
experience
and
views.
