hi
,
i
'm
suddenly
back
to
winforms
,
after
year
of
web
development
,
and
am
having
trouble
with
something
that
should
be
simple
.
i
have
an
arraylist
of
business
object
bound
to
a
windows
forms
datagrid
.
i
'd
like
the
user
to
be
able
to
edit
the
cell
,
and
when
finished
,
press
a
save
button
.
at
that
point
i
'd
like
to
iterate
the
all
the
row
and
column
in
the
datagrid
to
find
any
change
,
and
save
them
to
the
database
.
but
i
ca
n't
find
a
way
to
access
the
datagrid
row
.
i
'll
also
want
to
validate
individual
cell
real
time
,
a
they
are
edited
,
but
i
'm
pretty
sure
that
can
be
done
.
(
maybe
not
with
an
arraylist
a
the
datasource
?
)
but
a
for
iterating
the
datagrid
,
i
'm
quite
surprised
it
doe
n't
seem
possible
.
must
i
really
stuff
my
business
object
data
into
datatables
in
order
to
use
the
datagrid
?
thanks
,
mike
