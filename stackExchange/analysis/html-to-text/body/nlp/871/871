i
've
been
using
subversion
for
a
few
year
and
after
using
sourcesafe
,
i
just
love
subversion
.
combined
with
tortoisesvn
,
i
ca
n't
really
imagine
how
it
could
be
any
better
.
yet
there
's
a
growing
number
of
developer
claiming
that
subversion
ha
problem
and
that
we
should
be
moving
to
the
new
breed
of
distributed
version
control
system
,
such
a
git
.
how
doe
git
improve
upon
subversion
?
