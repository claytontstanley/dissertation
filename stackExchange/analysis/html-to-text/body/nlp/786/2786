i
started
trying
to
play
with
mono
,
mostly
for
fun
at
the
moment.
i
first
tried
to
use
the
vs
plugin
that
will
convert
a
csproj
into
a
makefile
,
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
version
available
for
vs2005.
i
also
read
about
the
monodevelop
ide
,
which
sounded
nice.
unfortunately
,
there
's
no
pre-fab
windows
package
for
it.
i
tried
to
follow
some
instruction
to
build
it
by
combining
dependency
from
other
semi-related
installs.
it
did
n't
work
,
but
that
's
probably
because
i
'm
a
windows-oriented
guy
and
can
barely
spell
``
makefile
''
.
so
,
my
question
is
this
:
what
's
the
lowest-energy
way
to
get
up
and
running
to
try
some
mono-based
development
on
windows
?
thanks
!
