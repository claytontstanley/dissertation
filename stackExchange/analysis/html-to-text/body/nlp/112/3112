i
have
a
perl
variable
$
result
that
get
returned
from
a
service
.
the
value
is
supposed
to
be
an
array
,
and
$
result
should
be
an
array
reference
.
however
,
when
the
array
ha
only
one
item
in
it
,
$
result
will
be
set
to
that
value
,
and
not
a
referenced
array
that
contains
that
one
item
.
i
want
to
do
a
foreach
loop
on
the
expected
array
.
without
checking
ref
(
$
result
)
eq
'array
'
,
is
there
any
way
to
have
something
equivalent
to
the
following
:
foreach
my
$
result
(
@
$
result
)
{
#
process
$
result
}
that
particular
code
sample
will
work
for
the
reference
,
but
will
complain
for
the
simple
scalar
.
edit
:
i
should
clarify
that
there
is
no
way
for
me
to
change
what
is
returned
from
the
service
.
the
problem
is
that
the
value
will
be
a
scalar
when
there
is
only
one
value
and
it
will
be
an
array
reference
when
there
is
more
than
one
value
.
