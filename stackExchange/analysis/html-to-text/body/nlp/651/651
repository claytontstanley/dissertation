i
've
been
having
trouble
getting
my
asp.net
application
to
automatically
log
user
into
the
intranet
site
i
'm
building.
no
matter
the
googling
or
the
experimentation
i
applied
,
there
is
always
a
login
box
displayed
by
ie7.
i
've
got
windows
authentication
mode
set
in
the
web.config
,
disabled
anonymous
access
and
configured
the
correct
default
domain
in
iis
,
but
it
's
still
asking
the
user
to
log
in
and
,
more
annoyingly
,
the
user
is
required
to
provide
the
domain
too
(
domain\auser
)
,
which
is
causing
problem
with
non-technical
visitors.
thank
zeus
for
password
remembering
functionality.
i
'm
not
the
network
administrator
so
it
's
possible
that
something
about
active
directory
is
set
up
incorrectly
,
or
it
could
just
be
me
missing
something
very
simple.
please
note
that
i
do
n't
want
to
impersonate
the
user
,
i
just
need
to
know
that
the
iprincipal.name
property
match
that
of
a
valid
record
in
my
user
database
,
hence
authenticating
the
user
to
my
application.
to
this
end
,
it
would
be
very
useful
to
have
a
checklist
of
all
configuration
requirement
for
ad
,
asp.net
and
iis
to
work
together
in
this
manner
a
a
reference
for
debugging
and
hopefully
reducing
some
user
friction
.
