django
view
point
to
a
function
,
which
can
be
a
problem
if
you
want
to
change
only
a
bit
of
functionality.
yes
,
i
could
have
million
keyword
argument
and
even
more
if
statement
in
the
function
,
but
i
wa
thinking
more
of
an
object
oriented
approach.
for
example
,
i
have
a
page
that
display
a
user.
this
page
is
very
similar
to
page
that
display
a
group
,
but
it
's
still
not
so
similar
to
just
use
another
data
model.
group
also
ha
member
etc
...
one
way
would
be
to
point
view
to
class
method
and
then
extend
that
class.
has
anyone
tried
this
approach
or
ha
any
other
idea
?
