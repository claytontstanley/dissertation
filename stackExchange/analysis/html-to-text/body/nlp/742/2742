i
'm
interested
in
looking
at
erlang
and
want
to
follow
the
path
of
least
resistance
in
getting
up
and
running
.
at
present
,
i
'm
planning
on
installing
erlang
r12b-3
and
erlide
(
eclipse
plugin
)
.
this
is
largely
a
google-result-based
decision
.
initially
this
will
be
on
a
windows
xp
system
,
though
i
am
likely
to
reproduce
the
environment
on
ubuntu
shortly
after
.
is
there
a
significantly
better
choice
?
even
if
it
is
tied
to
one
platform
.
please
share
your
experience
.
