my
company
is
in
the
process
of
starting
down
the
grails
path.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
current
developer
are
heavy
on
java
but
felt
the
need
for
a
mvc-style
language
for
some
future
web
development
projects.
personally
,
i
'm
coming
from
the
design/usability
world
,
but
a
i
take
more
``
front-end
''
responsibility
i
'm
starting
to
feel
the
need
for
learning
a
language
more
intensively
so
i
can
code
some
logic
but
especially
the
front-end
code
for
my
uis
and
stuff.
i
've
been
trying
to
get
into
python/django
personally
,
but
just
never
invested
too
much
time
on
it.
now
that
my
company
is
``
jumping
''
into
grails
i
bought
the
``
agile
web
development
with
rails
(
3rd
ed
-
beta
)
''
and
i
'm
starting
to
get
into
ror.
i
'd
still
like
to
learn
python
in
the
future
or
on
the
side
,
but
my
biggest
question
is
:
should
i
be
learning
ror
,
and
have
a
more
versatile
language
in
my
``
portfolio
''
,
knowing
that
my
ror
knowledge
will
be
useful
for
my
grails
need
a
well
?
?
-or-
should
i
just
skip
ror
and
focus
on
learning
grails
that
i
'll
be
needing
for
work
soon
,
and
work
on
learning
ror/django
(
ruby/python
)
later
?
basically
the
question
revolves
around
the
usefulness
of
grails
in
a
non-corporate
setting
and
the
similarity
between
rails
and
grails.
(
and
this
,
while
trying
to
avoid
the
centennial
discussion
of
python
v
ruby
(
on
rails
)

thanks
in
advance
folk
