first
of
all
,
i
know
how
to
build
a
java
application
.
but
i
wa
always
puzzled
where
to
put
my
class
.
there
are
proponent
for
organizing
the
package
strictly
domain
oriented
,
others
separate
by
tier
.
i
for
myself
have
always
problem
a
)
with
naming
,
b
)
with
placing
where
do
you
put
your
domain
specific
constant
(
and
what
is
the
best
name
for
such
a
class
)
?
where
do
you
put
class
for
stuff
which
is
both
infrastructural
and
domain
specific
(
for
instance
i
have
a
filestoragestrategy
class
,
which
store
the
file
either
in
the
database
,
or
alternatively
in
database
)
?
where
to
put
exceptions
?
are
there
any
standard
to
which
i
can
refer
?
