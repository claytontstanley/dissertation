i
will
probably
start
with
c
and
then
lisp.
although
i
started
programming
in
c
,
i
did
not
program
in
it
a
much
a
i
want.
it
's
fun
working
with
the
low
level
stuff.
learning
c
helped
me
a
lot
when
i
started
working.
i
've
only
started
learning
lisp
now
and
i
found
it
amazing
that
the
concept
it
supported
from
the
very
start
are
still
very
relevant
today.
well
i
think
it
's
better
late
than
never
.
