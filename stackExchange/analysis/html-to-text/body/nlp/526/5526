i
've
seen
the
mf
people
talk
and
have
heard
my
own
fair
share
of
mf
evangelism
,
yet
have
n't
done
anything
about
it
fearing
the
gain
are
n't
really
worth
the
hassle.
does
anyone
use
this
?
btw
,
from
their
website
:
''
microformats
are
a
set
of
simple
,
open
data
format
built
upon
existing
and
widely
adopted
standards.
instead
of
throwing
away
what
work
today
,
microformats
intend
to
solve
simpler
problem
first
by
adapting
to
current
behavior
and
usage
pattern
(
e.g.
xhtml
,
blogging
)
.
