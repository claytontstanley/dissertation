we
've
finally
moved
our
website
to
a
decent
host
,
and
for
the
first
time
we
have
shell
access.
i
know
very
little
about
using
linux
,
i
can
navigate
through
the
file
system
,
read
file
with
vim
and
i
'm
aware
of
the
man
command
,
and
i
have
been
able
to
work
out
solution
to
problem
a
they
show
up
(
eventually
)
,
but
i
know
i
'm
unaware
of
a
lot.
edit
:
we
currently
only
use
the
host
to
hold
our
live
site
,
i
'm
sure
that
we
use
it
more
effectively
,
but
i
'm
not
sure
where
to
start.
so
with
web
development
in
mind
:
what
are
the
essential
command
that
every
linux
user
should
know
about
?
what
are
the
most
useful
command
that
i
should
look
into
?
