one
of
the
fun
part
of
multi-cultural
programming
are
number
formats.
americans
use
10,000.50
,
germans
use
10.000,50
,
french
use
10
000,50
etc.
my
first
approach
would
be
:
take
the
string
,
parse
it
backwards
,
until
i
encounter
a
separator
and
use
this
a
my
decimal
separator.
the
obvious
flaw
with
that
:
10.000
would
be
interpreted
a
10.
another
approach
:
if
the
string
contains
2
different
non-numeric
character
,
use
the
last
one
a
the
decimal
separator
and
discard
the
others.
if
i
only
have
one
,
check
if
it
occurs
more
than
once
and
discard
it
if
it
does.
it
it
only
appears
once
,
check
if
it
ha
3
digit
after
it.
if
yes
,
discard
it
,
otherwise
use
it
a
decimal
separator.
the
obvious
``
best
solution
''
would
be
to
detect
the
user
's
culture
or
browser
,
but
that
doe
not
work
if
you
have
a
frenchman
an
an
en-us
windows/browser.
i
just
wonder
:
doe
the
.net
framework
contain
some
mythical
black
magic
floating
point
parser
that
is
better
than
double.
(
try
)
parse
(
)
in
trying
to
auto-detect
the
number
format
?
