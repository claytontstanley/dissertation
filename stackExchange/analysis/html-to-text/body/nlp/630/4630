example
:
i
have
two
shared
object
(
same
should
apply
to
.dlls
)
.
the
first
shared
object
is
from
a
third-party
library
,
we
'll
call
it
liba.so
.
i
have
wrapped
some
of
this
with
jni
and
created
my
own
library
,
libb.so
.
now
libb
depends
on
liba
.
when
webstarting
,
both
library
are
place
in
some
webstart
working
area
.
my
java
code
attempt
to
load
libb
.
at
this
point
the
system
loader
will
attempt
to
load
liba
which
is
not
in
the
system
library
path
(
java.library.path
wo
n't
help
this
)
.
the
end
result
is
that
libb
ha
an
unsatisfied
link
and
can
not
be
used
.
i
have
tried
loading
liba
before
libb
,
but
that
still
doe
not
work
.
seems
the
os
want
to
do
that
loading
for
me
.
is
there
any
way
i
can
make
this
work
other
than
statically
compiling
?
