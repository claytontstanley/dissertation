you
have
an
ascending
list
of
number
,
what
is
the
most
efficient
algorithm
you
can
think
of
to
get
the
ascending
list
of
sum
of
every
two
number
in
that
list.
duplicates
in
the
resulting
list
are
irrelevant
,
you
can
remove
them
or
avoid
them
if
you
like.
to
be
clear
,
i
'm
interested
in
the
algorithm.
feel
free
to
post
code
in
any
language
and
paradigm
that
you
like
.
