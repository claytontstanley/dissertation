getting
things
done
is
the
thing
these
day
.
while
the
basic
principle
is
only
about
keeping
a
todo
list
,
my
main
concern
is
maintaining
this
list
.
i
tried
using
e-mail
,
calendar
,
mind-mapping
,
bug
tracker
,
text
editor
,
note
,
paper
sheet
.
my
problem
is
that
all
these
tool
are
,
some
part
of
the
day
,
far
from
me
.
far
from
the
eye
,
far
from
the
heart
.
i
basically
forget
to
use
my
gtd
tool
.
funny
for
a
tool
that
is
intended
to
remind
me
of
everything
.
do
you
have
any
advice
on
a
gtd
tool
(
anything
from
software
to
little
white
rock
in
the
pocket
)
to
can
help
me
stay
focus
on
the
tool
?
(
please
provide
one
suggestion
per
answer
.
