is
there
an
easy
way
to
produce
msdn-style
documentation
from
the
visual
studio
xml
output
?
i
'm
not
patient
enough
to
set
up
a
good
xslt
for
it
because
i
know
i
'm
not
the
first
person
to
cross
this
bridge
.
also
,
i
tried
setting
up
sandcastle
recently
,
but
it
really
made
my
eye
cross
.
either
i
wa
missing
something
important
in
the
process
or
it
is
just
way
too
involved
.
i
know
somebody
out
there
ha
a
really
nice
dead-simple
solution
.
i
'm
reiterating
here
because
i
think
my
formatting
made
that
paragraph
non-inviting
to
read
:
i
gave
sandcastle
a
try
but
had
a
really
hard
time
getting
it
set
up
.
what
i
really
have
in
mind
is
something
much
simpler
.
that
is
,
unless
i
just
do
n't
understand
the
sandcastle
process
.
it
seemed
like
an
awful
lot
of
extra
baggage
to
me
just
to
produce
something
nice
for
the
tester
to
work
with
.
