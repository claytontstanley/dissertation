i
've
found
many
source
that
talk
about
the
automated
eclipse
pde
process
.
i
feel
these
source
do
n't
do
a
good
job
explaining
what
's
going
on
.
i
can
create
the
deployable
package
,
in
a
semi-manual
process
via
the
feature
export
.
the
automated
process
requires
knowledge
of
how
the
org.eclipse.pde.build
script
work
.
i
have
gotten
a
build
created
,
but
not
for
jnlp
.
questions
:
has
anyone
ever
deployed
rcp
through
jnlp
?
were
you
able
to
automate
the
build
?
