i
'm
looking
for
some
way
to
effectively
hide
inherited
member
.
i
have
a
library
of
class
which
inherit
from
common
base
class
.
some
of
the
more
recent
descendant
class
inherit
dependency
property
which
have
become
vestigial
and
can
be
a
little
confusing
when
using
intellisense
or
using
the
class
in
a
visual
designer
.
these
class
are
all
control
that
are
written
to
be
compiled
for
either
wpf
or
silverlight
2.0
.
i
know
about
icustomtypedescriptor
and
icustompropertyprovider
,
but
i
'm
pretty
certain
those
ca
n't
be
used
in
silverlight
.
it
's
not
a
much
a
functional
issue
a
a
usability
issue
.
what
should
i
do
?
update
:
some
of
the
property
that
i
would
really
like
to
hide
come
from
ancestor
that
are
not
my
own
and
because
of
a
specific
tool
i
'm
designing
for
,
i
ca
n't
do
member
hiding
with
the
new
operator
.
(
i
know
,
it
's
ridiculous
)
