note
:
i
am
using
sql
's
full-text
search
capability
,
contains
clause
and
all
-
the
*
is
the
wildcard
in
full-text
,
%
is
for
like
clause
only
.
i
've
read
in
several
place
now
that
``
leading
wildcard
''
search
(
e.g
.
using
``
*overflow
''
to
match
``
stackoverflow
''
)
is
not
supported
in
ms
sql
.
i
'm
considering
using
a
clr
function
to
add
regex
matching
,
but
i
'm
curious
to
see
what
other
solution
people
might
have
.
more
info
:
you
can
add
the
asterisk
only
at
the
end
of
the
word
or
phrase
.
-
along
with
my
empirical
experience
:
when
matching
``
myvalue
''
,
``
my*
''
work
,
but
``
(
asterisk
)
value
''
return
no
match
,
when
doing
a
query
a
simple
a
:
select
*
from
tablename
where
contains
(
textcolumn
,
'
''
*searchterm
''
'
)
;
thus
,
my
need
for
a
workaround
.
i
'm
only
using
search
in
my
site
on
an
actual
search
page
-
so
it
need
to
work
basically
the
same
way
that
google
work
(
in
the
eye
on
a
joe
sixpack-type
user
)
.
not
nearly
a
complicated
,
but
this
sort
of
match
really
should
n't
fail
.
