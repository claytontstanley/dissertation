how
much
database
performance
overhead
is
involved
with
using
c
#
and
linq
compared
to
custom
optimized
query
loaded
with
mostly
low-level
c
,
both
with
a
sql
server
2008
backend
?
i
'm
specifically
thinking
here
of
a
case
where
you
have
a
fairly
data-intensive
program
and
will
be
doing
a
data
refresh
or
update
at
least
once
per
screen
and
will
have
50-100
simultaneous
user
.
