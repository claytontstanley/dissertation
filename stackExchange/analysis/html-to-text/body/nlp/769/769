i
need
to
programmatically
solve
a
system
of
linear
equation
in
c
,
objective
c
,
or
(
if
needed
)
c++
.
here
's
an
example
of
the
equation
:
-44.3940
=
a
*
50.0
+
b
*
37.0
+
tx
-45.3049
=
a
*
43.0
+
b
*
39.0
+
tx
-44.9594
=
a
*
52.0
+
b
*
41.0
+
tx
from
this
,
i
'd
like
to
get
the
best
approximation
for
a
,
b
,
and
tx
.
