what
is
the
best
way
to
localise
a
date
format
descriptor
?
as
anyone
from
a
culture
which
doe
not
use
the
mm/dd/yyyy
format
know
,
it
is
annoying
to
have
to
enter
date
in
this
format
.
the
.net
framework
provides
some
very
good
localisation
support
,
so
it
's
trivial
to
parse
date
according
to
the
user
culture
,
but
you
often
want
to
also
display
a
helpful
hint
a
to
the
format
required
(
especially
to
distinguish
between
yy
and
yyyy
which
is
interchangeable
in
most
culture
)
.
what
is
the
best
way
to
do
this
with
result
that
make
sense
to
most
user
(
i.e
.
dd/m/yyy
is
confusing
because
of
the
change
in
case
and
the
switching
between
two
and
one
letter
)
.
