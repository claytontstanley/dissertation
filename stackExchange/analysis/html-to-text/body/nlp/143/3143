i
'm
compiling
a
nant
project
on
linux
with
teamcity
continuous
integration
server
.
i
have
been
able
to
generate
a
test
report
by
running
nant
on
mono
thru
a
command
line
runner
but
do
n't
have
the
option
of
using
the
report
like
a
nant
runner
.
i
'm
also
using
mbunit
for
the
testing
framework
.
how
can
i
merge
in
the
test
report
and
display
``
tests
failed
:
1
(
1
new
)
,
passed
:
3049
''
for
the
build
?
update
:
take
a
look
at
mbunittask
it
a
nant
task
that
us
sends
message
that
teamcity
expects
from
nunit
so
it
let
you
use
all
of
teamcity
's
feature
for
test
.
mbunittask
update
:
galio
ha
better
support
so
you
just
have
to
reference
the
galio
mbunit
3.5
dlls
instead
of
the
mbunit
3.5
dlls
and
switch
to
the
galio
runner
to
make
it
work
.
