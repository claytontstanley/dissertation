are
there
any
good
tutorial
or
guide
on
the
web
for
creating
pdf
file
programmatically
?
i
am
especially
thinking
of
discussing
best
practice
in
a
language-agnostic
way
,
though
something
tied
to
a
language
could
also
be
useful.
do
pdf
library
tend
to
have
multiple
apis
for
different
language
or
are
they
usually
tied
to
one
particular
technology
?
i
have
used
fpdf
in
the
past
and
it
served
it
purpose
,
but
i
would
certain
like
to
know
if
people
have
had
success
with
other
library
and
technique
.
