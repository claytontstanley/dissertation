i
'm
looking
for
good
suggestion
on
how
to
implement
version
and
source
control
for
web
projects.
i
've
looked
into
subversion
,
but
it
seems
to
only
take
care
of
code.
i
'm
really
looking
for
something
that
can
do
good
version-ing
,
branching
,
archival
,
etc.
with
not
only
source
code
,
but
other
web
asset
like
art
file
,
movie
clip
,
and
even
database
backups.
we
work
in
a
mixed
mac/pc
environment
,
so
visual
source
safe
or
anything
purely
pc
based
would
be
a
no
go.
any
help
?
