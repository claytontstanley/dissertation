my
office
ha
a
central
source
safe
2005
install
that
we
use
for
source
control
.
i
ca
n't
change
what
the
office
us
on
the
server
.
i
develop
on
a
laptop
and
would
like
to
have
a
different
local
source
control
repository
that
can
sync
with
the
central
server
(
when
available
)
regardless
of
the
what
that
central
provider
is
.
the
reason
for
the
request
is
so
i
can
maintain
a
local
stable
branch/build
for
client
presentation
while
continuing
to
develop
without
having
to
jump
through
flaming
hoop
.
also
,
a
a
consultant
,
my
client
may
request
that
i
use
their
source
control
provider
and
flexibility
here
would
make
life
easier
.
can
any
of
the
existing
distributed
source
control
client
handle
that
?
