if
i
have
.net
form
with
a
component/object
such
a
a
textbox
that
i
need
to
access
from
a
parent
or
other
form
i
obviously
need
to
``
upgrade
''
the
modifier
to
this
component
to
an
internal
or
public
level
variable
.
now
,
if
i
were
providing
a
public
variable
of
an
int
or
string
type
etc
.
in
my
form
class
i
would
n't
think
twice
about
using
getters
and
(
maybe
)
setters
around
this
,
even
if
they
did
n't
do
anything
other
than
provide
direct
access
to
the
variable
.
however
,
the
vs
designer
doe
n't
seem
to
implement
such
getters/setters
for
those
public
object
that
are
component
on
a
form
(
and
therefore
doe
not
comply
with
good
programming
practice
)
.
so
,
the
question
is
;
in
order
to
do
the
``
right
thing
''
should
i
wrap
such
vs
designer
component
or
object
in
a
getter
and/or
setter
?
?
