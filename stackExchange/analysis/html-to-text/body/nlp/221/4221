i
'd
like
to
use
a
linqdatasource
control
on
a
page
and
limit
the
amount
of
record
returned.
i
know
if
i
use
code
behind
i
could
do
something
like
this
:
ienumerable
<
int
>
value
=
enumerable.range
(
0
,
10
)
;
ienumerable
<
int
>
take3
=
values.take
(
3
)
;
does
anyone
know
if
something
like
this
is
possible
with
a
linqdatasource
control
?
[
update
]
i
'm
going
to
use
the
linqdatasource
with
the
listview
control
,
not
a
gridview
or
repeater.
the
linqdatasource
wizard
doe
not
provide
the
ability
to
limit
the
number
of
record
return.
the
advanced
option
only
allow
you
to
enabled
deletes
,
insert
,
and
update
.
