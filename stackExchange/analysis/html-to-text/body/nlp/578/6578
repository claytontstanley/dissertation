i
'm
just
beginning
to
have
a
look
at
objective
c
and
cocoa
with
a
view
to
playing
with
he
iphone
sdk
.
i
'm
reasonably
comfortable
with
c
's
malloc
and
free
concept
,
but
cocoa
's
reference
counting
scheme
ha
me
rather
confused
.
i
'm
told
it
's
very
elegant
once
you
understand
it
,
but
i
'm
just
not
over
the
hump
yet
.
i
guess
my
question
is
,
can
anyone
briefly
explain
release
,
retain
and
autorelease
and
the
convention
about
their
use
in
a
way
which
make
it
click
for
me
?
(
or
failing
that
,
what
did
you
read
which
helped
you
get
it
?
)
