my
pc
ha
had
trouble
recently
but
now
it
wo
n't
boot
into
window
.
i
put
in
a
new
hdd
and
reinstalled
window
but
now
i
want
to
get
the
info
off
the
old
hdd
.
what
linux
distro
can
allow
me
to
read
and
possibly
repair
my
old
hard
drive
?
i
've
used
knoppix
a
while
back
and
it
wa
good
,
but
is
there
something
i
can
download
that
is
much
smaller
than
700mb
?
the
distro
should
have
ntfs
write
ability
too
.
