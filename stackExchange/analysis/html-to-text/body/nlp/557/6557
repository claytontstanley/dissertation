it
seems
that
a
list
object
can
not
be
stored
in
a
list
variable
in
c
#
,
and
ca
n't
even
be
explicitly
cast
that
way.
list

string

sl
=
new
list

(
)
;
list

object
>
ol
;
ol
=
sl
;
result
in
can
not
implicitly
convert
type
‘system.collections.generic.list’
to
‘system.collections.generic.list’
and
then

of

,
you
can
do
it
by
pulling
everything
out
of
the
string
list
and
putting
it
back
in
one
at
a
time
,
but
it
is
a
rather
convoluted
solution
.
