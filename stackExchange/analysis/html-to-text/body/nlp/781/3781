when
prototyping
initial
gui
functionality
with
a
customer
is
it
better
to
use
a
pen/paper
drawing
or
to
mock
something
up
using
a
tool
and
show
them
that
?
the
argument
against
a
tool
generated
design
being
that
the
customer
can
sometimes
focus
on
the
low-level
specific
of
the
mock-up
rather
than
taking
a
higher
level
functional
view
of
the
gui
overall
.
