i
have
been
looking
for
a
way
to
utilize
a
simple
markup
language
,
or
just
plain
html
,
when
displaying
text
in
winform
applications.
i
would
like
to
avoid
embedding
a
webbrowser
control
since
in
most
of
the
case
i
just
want
to
highlight
a
single
word
or
two
in
a
sentence.
i
have
looked
at
using
a
rtfcontrol
but
i
believe
it
's
a
bit
heavy
and
i
do
n't
think
the
``
language
''
used
to
do
the
formatting
is
easy.
is
there
a
simple
control
that
allows
me
to
display
string
like
:
this
is
a
sample
string
with
different
formating.
i
would
be
really
neat
if
it
wa
also
possible
to
specify
a
font
and/or
size
for
the
text.
oh
,
dotnet
3.5
and
wpf/xaml
is
not
an
option
.
