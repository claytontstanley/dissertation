even
though
i
always
strive
for
complete
validation
these
day
,
i
often
wonder
if
it
's
a
waste
of
time.
if
the
code
run
and
it
look
the
same
in
all
browser
(
i
use
browsershots.org
to
verify
)
then
do
i
need
to
take
it
any
further
or
am
i
just
being
overly
anal
?
what
level
do
you
hold
your
code
to
when
you
create
it
for
:
a
)
yourself
b
)
your
client
p.s.
jeff
and
company
,
why
doe
n't
stack
overflow
validate
?
:
)
edit
:
some
good
insight
,
i
think
that
since
i
've
been
so
valid-obsessed
for
so
long
i
program
knowing
what
will
cause
problem
and
what
wo
n't
so
i
'm
in
a
better
position
than
people
who
create
a
site
first
and
then
``
go
back
and
fix
the
validation
problem
''
i
think
i
may
post
another
question
on
stack
overflow
;
``
do
you
validate
a
you
go
or
do
you
finish
and
then
go
back
and
validate
?
''
a
that
seems
to
be
where
this
question
is
going
