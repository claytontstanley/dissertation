we
've
been
having
some
issue
with
a
sharepoint
instance
in
a
test
environment
.
thankfully
this
is
not
production
;
)
the
problem
started
when
the
disk
with
the
sql
server
database
and
search
index
ran
out
of
space
.
following
this
,
the
search
service
would
not
run
and
search
setting
in
the
ssp
were
not
accessible
.
reclaiming
the
disk
space
did
not
resolve
the
issue
.
so
rather
than
restoring
the
vm
,
we
decided
to
try
to
fix
the
issue
.
we
created
a
new
ssp
and
changed
the
association
of
all
service
to
the
new
ssp
.
the
old
ssp
and
it
's
database
were
then
deleted
.
search
result
for
pdf
file
are
no
longer
appearing
,
but
the
search
work
fine
otherwise
.
mysites
also
work
ok
.
following
the
implementation
of
this
change
,
these
problem
occur
:
1
)
an
audit
failure
message
started
appearing
in
the
application
event
log
,
for
'domain\spmosssvc
'
which
is
the
moss
farm
account
.

)
sql
server
profiler
is
showing
query
from
sharepoint
that
reference
the
old
(
deleted
)
ssp
database
.
so
...
where
would
these
reference
to
domain\spmosssvc
and
the
old
ssp
database
exist
?
is
there
a
way
to
'completely
'
remove
the
ssp
from
the
server
,
and
re-create
?
the
option
to
delete
wa
not
available
(
greyed
out
)
when
a
single
ssp
is
in
place
.
