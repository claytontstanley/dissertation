one
of
those
classic
programming
interview
question
...
you
are
given
two
marble
,
and
told
that
they
will
break
when
dropped
from
some
certain
height
(
and
presumably
suffer
no
damage
if
dropped
from
below
that
height
)
.
youâ€™re
then
taken
to
a
100
story
building
(
presumably
higher
than
the
certain
height
)
,
and
asked
to
find
the
highest
floor
your
can
drop
a
marble
from
without
breaking
it
a
efficiently
a
possible
.
extra
info
you
must
find
the
correct
floor
(
not
a
possible
range
)
the
marble
are
both
guaranteed
to
break
at
the
same
floor
assume
it
take
zero
time
for
you
to
change
floor
-
only
the
number
of
marble
drop
count
assume
the
correct
floor
is
randomly
distributed
in
the
building
