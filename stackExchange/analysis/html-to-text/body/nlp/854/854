similar
but
different
to
keyboard
for
programmer
,
simply
put
,
what
keyboard
layout
is
the
best
?
i
'm
using
colemak
and
it
's
good
but
i
do
n't
think
it
's
actually
faster
than
qwerty
.
dvorak
wa
certainly
(
for
me
anyway
)
not
very
fast
at
all.
i
have
however
found
that
colemak
is
not
so
strain-inducing
a
qwerty
.
