i
am
aware
in
dot
net
there
are
three
timer
type
(
see
http
:
//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc164015.aspx
)
.
i
have
chosen
a
the
threaded
timer
a
the
other
type
can
drift
if
the
main
thread
is
busy
and
i
need
this
to
be
reliable
.
the
way
this
timer
work
in
the
control
of
the
timer
is
put
on
another
thread
so
it
can
always
tick
along
with
the
work
begin
completed
on
the
parent
thread
when
it
is
not
busy
.
the
issue
i
have
is
that
with
this
timer
in
a
console
application
is
that
while
the
timer
is
ticking
along
on
another
thread
the
main
thread
is
not
doing
anything
so
the
app
close
.
i
tried
adding
a
while
true
loop
but
then
the
main
thread
is
too
busy
when
the
timer
doe
go
off
.
any
idea
welcome
.
