i
'm
making
a
webform
using
a
loginview
,
the
problem
is
that
because
the
control
includes
a
grey
bar
telling
you
what
type
of
control
it
is
it
throw
of
correctly
formatting
the
page
(
it
ha
loginview1
at
the
top
)
,
is
there
a
way
to
hide
this
on
the
loginview
a
the
contentplaceholder
doe
an
excellent
job
for
this
.
i
've
found
that
you
can
remove
the
id
,
but
that
seems
like
a
hack
a
it
stop
programatic
access
