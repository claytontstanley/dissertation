i
need
to
send
and
receive
data
over
serial
connection
(
rs-232
and
rs-422
)
.
how
do
i
set
up
and
communicate
with
such
a
connection
?
how
do
i
figure
out
what
the
configuration
setting
(
e.g
.
baud
rate
)
should
be
and
how
do
i
set
them
?
in
particular
i
am
looking
to
do
this
in
java
,
c/c++
,
or
one
of
the
major
unix
shell
but
i
also
have
some
interest
in
serial
programming
using
windows/hyperterminal
.
