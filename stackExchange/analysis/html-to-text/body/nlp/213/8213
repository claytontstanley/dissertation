i
need
to
import
a
csv
file
into
firebird
and
i
've
spent
a
couple
of
hour
trying
out
some
tool
and
none
fit
my
needs.
the
main
problem
is
that
all
the
tool
i
've
been
trying
like
ems
data
import
and
firebird
data
wizard
expect
that
my
csv
file
contains
all
the
information
needed
by
my
table.
i
need
to
write
some
custom
sql
in
the
insert
statement
,
for
example
,
i
have
a
cv
file
with
the
city
name
,
but
a
my
database
already
ha
all
the
city
in
another
table
(
normalized
)
,
i
need
to
write
a
subselect
in
the
insert
statement
to
lookup
for
the
city
and
write
it
id
,
also
i
have
a
stored
procedure
to
cread
guids.
my
insert
statement
would
be
something
like
this
:
insert
into
person
(
id
,
name
,
cityid
)
values
(
(
select
newguid
from
createguid
)
,
:
name
,
(
select
cityid
from
city
where
name
=
:
city_name
)
i
know
that
it
is
very
easy
to
write
an
application
to
do
this
,
but
i
do
n't
like
to
reinvent
the
wheel
,
and
i
'm
sure
that
there
are
some
tool
out
there
to
do
it.
can
you
guy
give
me
some
advice
?
