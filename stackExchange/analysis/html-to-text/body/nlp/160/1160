i
am
using
ccnet
on
a
sample
project
with
svn
a
my
source
control.
ccnet
is
configured
to
create
a
build
on
every
check
in.
ccnet
us
msbuild
to
build
the
source
code.
i
would
like
to
use
the
latest
revision
number
to
generate
assemblyinfo.cs
while
compiling.
how
can
i
retrieve
the
latest
revision
from
subversion
and
use
the
value
in
ccnet
?
edit
:
i
'm
not
using
nant
-
only
msbuild
.
