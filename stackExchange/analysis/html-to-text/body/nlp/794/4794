i
've
written
(
most
of
)
an
application
in
flex
and
i
am
concerned
with
protecting
the
source
code
.
i
fired
up
a
demo
of
trillix
swf
decompiler
and
opened
up
the
swf
file
that
wa
installed
to
my
program
files
directory
.
i
saw
that
all
of
the
actionscript
package
i
wrote
were
there
.
i
'm
not
too
concerned
with
the
package
,
even
though
there
is
a
substantial
amount
of
code
,
because
it
still
seems
pretty
unusable
without
the
mxml
file
.
i
think
they
are
converted
to
actionscript
,
or
atleast
i
hope
.
however
,
i
would
still
like
to
explore
obfuscation
.
does
anyone
have
any
experience
with
flash
/
actionscript
3
/
flex
obfuscators
?
can
you
recommend
a
good
product
?
