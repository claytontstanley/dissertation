i
am
looking
to
put
a
camera
on
top
of
a
building
in
the
process
of
being
built
and
stream
it
to
a
website
.
how
would
i
go
about
doing
this
?
would
i
have
to
hook
it
up
to
a
full-blown
computer
on-site
?
or
can
i
just
plug
it
into
a
dvr
with
an
internet
connection
?
what
is
involved
with
processing
the
stream
?
