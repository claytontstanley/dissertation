ok
,
i
'm
a
web
developer
,
but
i
find
myself
dabbling
in
window
form
project
every
now
and
then.
one
thing
that
confounds
me
to
this
day
is
the
following.
assume
you
are
doing
something
like
the
following
list
<
string
>
myitems
=
new
list
<
string
>
{
``
item
1
''
,
``
item
2
''
,
``
item
3
''
}
;
combobox
box
=
new
combobox
(
)
;
box.datasource
=
myitems
;
combobox
box2
=
new
combobox
(
)
;
box2.datasource
=
myitems
so
now
we
have
2
combo
box
bound
to
that
array
,
and
everything
work
fine.
but
when
you
change
the
value
of
one
combo
box
,
it
change
both
combo
box
to
the
one
you
just
selected.
now
,
i
know
that
arrays
are
always
passed
by
reference
(
learned
that
when
i
learned
c
:
d
)
,
but
why
on
earth
would
the
combo
box
change
together
?
i
do
n't
believe
the
combo
box
control
is
modifying
the
collection
at
all.
as
a
work
around
,
do
n't
this
would
achieve
the
funcionality
that
is
expected
/
desired
combobox
box
=
new
combobox
(
)
;
box.datasource
=
myitems.toarray
(
)
;
