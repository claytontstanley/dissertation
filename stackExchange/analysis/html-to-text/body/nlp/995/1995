have
value
stored
a
string
in
a
datatable
where
each
value
could
really
represent
an
int

(
they
were
all
converted
to
string
during
an
import
process
from
an
external
data
source
)
.
i
need
to
test
and
see
what
type
each
value
really
is
.

is
more
efficient
for
the
application
(
or
is
there
no
practical
difference
)

to
convert
to
int
(
and
then
double
)
.
if
conversion
work
,
the
return
true
.

an
exception
is
thrown
,
return
false
.
regular
expression
designed
to
match
the
pattern
of
an
int

other
method
?
