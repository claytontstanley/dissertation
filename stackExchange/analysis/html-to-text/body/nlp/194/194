yes
,
i
know
.
the
existence
of
a
running
copy
of
sql
server
6.5
in
2008
is
absurd
.
that
stipulated
,
what
is
the
best
way
to
migrate
from
6.5
to
2005
?
is
there
any
direct
path
?
most
of
the
documentation
i
've
found
deal
with
upgrading
6.5
to
7
.
should
i
forget
about
the
native
sql
server
upgrade
utility
,
script
out
all
of
the
object
and
data
,
and
try
to
recreate
from
scratch
?
i
wa
going
to
attempt
the
upgrade
this
weekend
,
but
server
issue
pushed
it
back
till
next
.
so
,
any
idea
would
be
welcomed
during
the
course
of
the
week
.
update
.
this
is
how
i
ended
up
doing
it
:
back
up
the
database
in
question
and
master
on
6.5
.
execute
sql
server
2000
's
instcat.sql
against
6.5
's
master
.
this
allows
sql
server
2000
's
oledb
provider
to
connect
to
6.5
.
use
sql
server
2000
's
standalone
``
import
and
export
data
''
to
create
a
dts
package
,
using
oledb
to
connect
to
6.5
.
this
successfully
copied
all
6.5
's
table
to
a
new
2005
database
(
also
using
oledb
)
.
use
6.5
's
enterprise
manager
to
script
out
all
of
the
database
's
index
and
trigger
to
a
.sql
file
.
execute
that
.sql
file
against
the
new
copy
of
the
database
,
in
2005
's
management
studio
.
use
6.5
's
enterprise
manager
to
script
out
all
of
the
stored
procedure
.
execute
that
.sql
file
against
the
2005
database
.
several
dozen
sprocs
had
issue
making
them
incompatible
with
2005
.
mainly
non-ansi
join
and
quoted
identifier
issue
.
corrected
all
of
those
issue
and
re-executed
the
.sql
file
.
recreated
the
6.5
's
logins
in
2005
and
gave
them
appropriate
permission
.
there
wa
a
bit
of
rinse/repeat
when
correcting
the
stored
procedure
(
there
were
hundred
of
them
to
correct
)
,
but
the
upgrade
went
great
otherwise
.
being
able
to
use
management
studio
instead
of
query
analyzer
and
enterprise
manager
6.5
is
such
an
amazing
difference
.
a
few
report
query
that
took
20-30
second
on
the
6.5
database
are
now
running
in
1-2
second
,
without
any
modification
,
new
index
,
or
anything
.
i
did
n't
expect
that
kind
of
immediate
improvement
.
