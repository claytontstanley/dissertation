i
wa
(
and
still
am
)
looking
for
an
embedded
database
to
be
used
in
a
.net
(
c
#
)
application.
the
caveat
:
the
application
(
or
at
least
the
database
)
is
stored
on
a
network
drive
,
but
only
used
by
1
user
at
a
time.
now
,
my
first
idea
wa
sql
server
compact
edition
.
that
is
really
nicely
integreated
,
but
it
can
not
run
off
a
network.
firebird
seems
to
have
the
same
issue
,
but
the
.net
integration
seems
to
be
not
really
first-class
and
is
largely
undocumented.
blackfish
sql
look
interesting
,
but
there
is
no
trial
of
the
.net
version.
pricing
is
also
ok.
any
other
suggestion
of
something
that
work
well
with
.net
and
run
off
a
network
without
the
need
of
actually
installing
a
server
software
?
