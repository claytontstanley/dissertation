i
hope
this
is
n't
too
obscureâ€¦
i
'll
ask
the
newsgroup
if
nobody
know
here
]
i
'm
using
pylons
(
a
python
framework
)
to
serve
a
simple
web
application
,
but
it
seems
to
die
from
time
to
time
,
with
this
in
the
error
log
:
(
2006
,
'mysql
server
ha
gone
away
'
)
i
did
a
bit
of
checking
,
and
saw
that
this
wa
because
the
connection
to
mysql
were
not
being
renewed.
this
should
n't
be
a
problem
though
,
because
the
sqlalchemy.pool_recycle
in
the
config
file
should
automatically
keep
it
alive.
the
default
wa
3600
,
but
i
dialed
it
back
to
1800
because
of
this
problem.
it
helped
a
bit
,
but
3600
should
be
fine
according
to
the
docs.
the
error
still
happen
semi-regularly.
i
do
n't
want
to
lower
it
too
much
though
and
dos
my
own
database
:
)
.
maybe
something
in
my
mysql
config
is
goofy
?
not
sure
where
to
look
exactly.
