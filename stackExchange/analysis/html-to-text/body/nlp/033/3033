if
i
have
a
perl
hash
with
a
bunch
of
(
key
,
value
)
pair
,
what
is
the
preferred
method
of
iterating
through
all
the
key
?
i
have
heard
that
using
each
may
in
some
way
have
unintended
side
effects.
so
,
is
that
true
,
and
is
one
of
the
two
following
method
best
,
or
is
there
a
better
way
?
#
method
1
while
(
my
(
$
key
,
$
value
)
=
each
(
%
hash
)
)
{
#
something
}
#
method
2
foreach
my
$
key
(
key
(
%
hash
)
)
{
#
something
}
