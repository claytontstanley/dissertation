we
're
in
the
process
of
upgrading
one
of
our
sql
server
instance
from
2000
to
2005
.
i
installed
the
performance
dashboard
(

)
for
access
to
some
high
level
reporting
.
one
of
the
report
show
missing
(
recommended
)
index
.
i
think
it
's
based
on
some
system
view
that
is
maintained
by
the
query
optimizer
.
my
question
is
what
is
the
best
way
to
determine
when
to
take
an
index
recommendation
.
i
know
that
it
doe
n't
make
sense
to
apply
all
of
the
optimizer
's
suggestion
.
i
see
a
lot
of
advice
that
basically
say
to
try
the
index
and
to
keep
it
if
performance
improves
and
to
drop
it
if
performance
degrades
or
stay
the
same
.
i
wondering
if
there
is
a
better
way
to
make
the
decision
and
what
best
practice
exist
on
this
subject
.
