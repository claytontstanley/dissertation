boy
how
i
hate
css
!
it
's
an
art
that
i
have
no
clue
about
!
spend
hour
making
everything
look
dandy
then
you
look
at
the
same
site
in
a
different
browser
...
wt
...
i
though
this
wa
supposed
to
be
a
standard
!
!

what
i
really
want
is
a
wyciwyg
editor.
no
not
dreamweaver
!
an
editor
where
you
can
define
an
element
and
immediately
see
it
's
effect
on
screen
more
importantly
drag
it
around
the
screen.
even
better
is
an
editor
that
(
somehow
)
allows
you
to
draw
element
around
the
screen.
that
would
be
a
real
editor
!
on
top
of
this
i
would
like
it
to
auto
fix
up
all
the
browser
specific
poo
so
that
it
look
the
same
in
all
popular
browser
(
i
just
do
n't
want
to
think
/
worry
about
it
)
.
btw
i
am
not
a
designer
,
i
'm
a
programmer
forced
into
there
world
