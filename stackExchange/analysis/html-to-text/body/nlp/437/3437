we
recently
discovered
that
the
google
maps
api
doe
not
play
nicely
with
ssl.
fair
enough
,
but
what
are
some
option
for
overcoming
this
that
others
have
used
effectively
?
will
the
maps
api
work
over
ssl
(
https
)
?
at
this
time
,
the
maps
api
is
not
available
over
a
secure
(
ssl
)
connection.
if
you
are
running
the
maps
api
on
a
secure
site
,
the
browser
may
warn
the
user
about
non-secure
object
on
the
screen.
we
have
considered
the
following
option
splitting
the
page
so
that
credit
card
collection
(
the
requirement
for
ssl
)
is
not
on
the
same
page
a
the
google
map.
switching
to
another
map
provider
,
such
a
virtual
earth.
rumor
ha
it
that
they
support
ssl.
playing
trick
with
iframes.
sounds
kludgy.
proxying
the
call
to
google.
sounds
like
a
lot
of
overhead.
are
there
other
option
,
or
doe
anyone
have
insight
into
the
option
that
we
have
considered
?
