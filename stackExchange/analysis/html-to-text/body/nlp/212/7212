what
i
'd
like
to
do
is
something
like
the
following
:
fooclass.prototype.method
=
function
(
)
:
string
{
return
``
something
''
;
}
var
foo
:
fooclass
=
new
fooclass
(
)
;
foo.method
(
)
;
which
is
to
say
,
i
'd
like
to
extend
a
generated
class
with
a
single
method
,
not
via
inheritance
but
via
the
prototype.
the
class
is
generated
from
a
wsdl
,
it
's
not
a
dynamic
class
,
and
i
do
n't
want
to
touch
the
generated
code
because
it
will
be
overwritten
anyway.
long
story
short
,
i
'd
like
to
have
the
moral
equivalent
of
c
#
3
:
s
extension
methods
for
as3.
edit
:
i
accepted
aib
's
answer
,
because
it
fit
what
i
wa
asking
best
--
although
upon
further
reflection
it
doe
n't
really
solve
my
problem
,
but
that
's
my
fault
for
asking
the
wrong
question.
