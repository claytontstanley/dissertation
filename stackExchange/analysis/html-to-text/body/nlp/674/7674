we
have
a
custom-built
flash-based
video
player
that
i
maintain
,
and
it
need
to
support
preroll
ad
and
ideally
both
progressive
video
playback
and
streaming
depending
on
a
server
switch.
i
've
been
working
with
the
flvplayback
component
but
am
finding
myself
a
little
out
of
my
depth.
are
there
any
good
tutorial
or
resource
for
understanding
the
difference
between
netstream
and
flvplayback
?
or
is
one
part
of
the
other
?
have
googled
without
success.
for
the
preroll
ad
we
'll
probably
use
dart
in-stream
,
which
is
part
of
the
reason
i
feel
i
'm
losing
a
grip
on
the
best
way
to
structure
this
thing.
any
help
with
best
practice
or
link
most
appreciated

update
:
i
wrote
a
player
by
hand
and
got
it
more
or
le
working
with
everything
it
needed
to
do
,
but
we
did
migrate
to
jw
player
across
all
the
web
property
in
the
end
,
about
six
month
later.
it
's
very
reliable
and
well-supported
,
it
integrated
with
the
dart
system
well
,
and
the
designer
found
it
easy
to
skin
.
