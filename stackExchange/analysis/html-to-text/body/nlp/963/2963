how
many
folk
are
doing
this
and
what
are
your
motivation
for
doing
so
?
i
converted
because
i
wanted
to
run
hyper-v
so
i
could
build
and
test
on
64
bit
guest
os
vm
's
.
in
general
the
experience
ha
been
pretty
good
,
i
've
learned
a
heap
about
managing
a
2008
environment
.
i
've
also
been
pretty
lucky
in
that
all
of
the
driver
for
my
dell
t5400
just
work
.
there
's
still
a
couple
of
niggles
though
where
the
ui
get
momentarily
laggy
if
there
's
background
network
io
e.g
.
ie
or
firefox
grabbing
image
from
third
party
site
,
or
the
rdp
client
performing
the
initial
handshake
to
a
remote
server
(
even
a
local
running
vm
)
.
your
experience
?

@
bestsnowman
i
'm
working
locally
.
it
's
the
host
2008
os
ui
that
get
laggy
.
for
example
when
i
log
off
of
an
rdp
session
(
to
a
hyper-v
guest
vm
or
a
real
machine
at
a
remote
location
like
our
dc
)
the
sound
distorts
(
if
i
'm
playing
music
)
and
the
ui
get
sluggish
for
around
10
second
.
it
's
annoying
but
something
i
've
resigned
myself
to
live
with
.
it
's
certainly
not
a
perf
issue
with
the
machine
because
it
's
a
newish
dell
precision
t5400
with
12gb
ram
,
a
quad
core
xeon
3ghz
and
a
pair
of
73gb
15k
rpm
sas
disk
.
the
video
card
is
an
nvidia
geforce
8800
gts
.
all
the
driver
are
up
to
date
.
