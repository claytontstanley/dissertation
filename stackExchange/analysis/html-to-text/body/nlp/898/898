how
have
you
implement
internationalization
(
18n
)
in
actual
project
you
've
worked
on
?
i
took
an
interest
in
making
software
cross-cultural
after
i
read
the
famous
post
by
joel
,
the
absolute
minimum
every
software
developer
absolutely
,
positively
must
know
about
unicode
and
character
sets
(
no
excuses
!
)
.
however
i
have
yet
to
able
to
take
advantage
of
this
in
a
real
project
besides
making
sure
i
used
unicode
string
where
possible
.
but
making
all
your
string
unicode
and
ensuring
you
understand
what
encoding
everything
you
work
with
is
in
is
just
the
tip
of
the
i18n
iceberg
.
everything
i
have
worked
on
to
date
ha
been
for
use
by
a
controlled
set
of
us
english
speaking
people
or
i18n
just
wa
n't
something
we
had
time
to
work
on
before
pushing
the
project
live
.
so
i
am
looking
for
any
tip
or
war
story
people
have
about
making
software
more
localized
in
real
world
project
.
