let
me
preface
this
question
by
saying
i
use
textmate
on
mac
osx
for
my
text
need
and
i
am
in
love
with
it
.
anything
comparable
on
the
linux
platform
?
i
'll
mostly
use
it
for
coding
python/ruby
.
doing
a
google
search
yielded
outdated
answer
.
edit
:
since
there
ha
been
some
concern
about
the
'merit
'
of
this
question
.
i
am
about
to
start
a
new
ruby
programming
project
in
linux
and
before
i
got
started
i
wanted
to
make
sure
i
had
the
right
tool
to
do
the
job
.
edit
#
2
:
i
use
vim
on
a
daily
basis
--
all
.
the
.
time
.
i
enjoy
using
it
.
i
wa
just
looking
for
some
alternative
.
