i
'm
writing
a
few
little
bash
script
under
ubuntu
linux.
i
want
to
be
able
to
run
them
from
the
gui
without
needing
a
terminal
window
to
enter
any
input
or
view
any
output.
so
far
the
only
input
required
is
a
password
for
sudo
-
and
gksudo
handle
that
fine.
but
i
have
n't
found
an
easy
way
to
show
a
message
box
yet.
is
there
some
kind
of
'gkmessage
'
command
available
?
i
'd
prefer
something
present
in
a
default
ubuntu
install
,
but
i
do
n't
mind
installing
a
new
package
if
necessary
.
