i
am
writing
an
application
that
downloads
large
file
in
the
background
.
all
client
are
logged
in
locally
,
or
through
a
vpn
.
when
they
are
logged
in
locally
,
i
do
not
want
to
throttle
downloads
.
however
,
i
would
like
to
limit
downloads
to
10
kbps
when
the
user
is
connected
via
vpn
.
i
can
differentiate
between
these
user
by
ip
address
range
.
since
this
is
an
air
application
,
i
figure
i
will
throttle
via
server-side
since
i
can
do
it
from
either
the
server
itself
(
iis
6
)
or
the
web
service
(
asp.net
/
c
#
)
.
throttling
through
iis
6
seems
to
work
fine
,
but
it
seems
like
it
ha
to
be
done
across
the
entire
web
site
.
is
there
anyway
to
do
this
via
ip
?
or
will
i
have
to
rig
this
up
in
.net
?
thanks
in
advance
...
