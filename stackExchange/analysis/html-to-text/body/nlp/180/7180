what
is
a
good
way
to
perform
animation
using
.net
?
i
would
prefer
not
to
use
flash
if
possible
,
so
am
looking
for
suggestion
of
way
which
will
work
to
implement
different
type
of
animation
on
a
new
site
i
am
producing
.
the
new
site
is
for
a
magician
,
so
i
want
to
provide
animated
button
(
cards
turning
over
,
etc
.
)
and
also
embed
video
.
is
it
possible
to
do
this
without
using
flash
or
is
this
the
only
real
solution
?
i
would
like
to
keep
it
a
cross-platform
and
standard
a
possible
.
