am
looking
to
allow
user
to
control
of
subdomain
of
an
app
i
am
toying
with
,
much
like
basecamp
where
it
is
'customusername.seework.com'.

required
on
the
dns
end
to
allow
these
to
be
created
dynamically
and
be
available
instantly.
and
how
do
you
recommend
dealing
with
this
in
the
logic
of
the
site
?
htaccess

to
lookup
the
subdomain
in
the
db
?
