i
need
to
be
able
to
manipulate
a
large
(
10^7
node
)
graph
in
python.
the
data
corresponding
to
each
node/edge
is
minimal
,
say
,
a
small
number
of
strings.
what
is
the
most
efficient
,
in
term
of
memory
and
speed
,
way
of
doing
this
?
a
dict
of
dicts
is
more
flexible
and
simpler
to
implement
,
but
i
intuitively
expect
a
list
of
list
to
be
faster.
the
list
option
would
also
require
that
i
keep
the
data
separate
from
the
structure
,
while
dicts
would
allow
for
something
of
the
sort
:
graph
[
i
]
[
j
]
[
``
property
''
]
=
''
value
''
what
would
you
suggest
?
