every
week
i
put
up
a
bunch
of
.jpg
screen
capture
on
my
project
's
wiki
to
show
the
difference
between
this
week
's
status
and
last
week
.
the
file
are
called
thing
like
programmeratasks_current.jpg
and
programmerbtasks_lastweek.jpg
so
there
is
a
pair
of
*_current.jpg
and
*_lastweek.jpg
for
each
status
.
each
week
i
delete
the
old
*_lastweek.jpg
and
then
rename
the
old
*current
to
*lastweek
.
i
can
use
rm
*_lastweek*
to
do
the
first
part
of
the
task
,
but
how
do
i
automate
renaming
*_current.jpg
to
*_lastweek.jpg
?
