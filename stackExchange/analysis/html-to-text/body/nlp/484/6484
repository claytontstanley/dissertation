mocking
sealed
class
can
be
quite
a
pain.
i
currently
favor
an
adapter
pattern
to
handle
this
,
but
something
about
just
keep
feel
weird.
so
,
what
is
the
best
way
you
mock
sealed
class
?
java
answer
are
more
than
welcome.
in
fact
,
i
would
anticipate
that
the
java
community
ha
been
dealing
with
this
longer
and
ha
a
great
deal
to
offer.
but
here
are
some
of
the
.net
opinion
:
why
duck
typing
matters
for
c
#
develoepers
creating
wrapper
for
sealed
and
other
type
for
mocking
unit
test
for
wcf
(
and
moq
)
