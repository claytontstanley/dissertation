i
have
a
page
upon
which
a
user
can
choose
up
to
many
differ
paragraphs.
when
the
link
is
clicked
(
or
button
)
,
an
email
will
open
up
and
put
all
those
paragraph
into
the
body
of
the
email
,
address
it
,
and
fill
in
the
subject.
however
,
the
text
can
bee
too
long
for
a
mailto
link.
any
way
around
this
?
thanks.
we
were
thinking
about
having
an
sp
from
the
sql
server
do
it
but
the
user
need
a
nice
way
of
'seeing
'
the
email
before
they
blast
50
executive
level
employee
with
item
that
should
n't
be
sent
...
and
of
course
there
's
the
whole
thing
about
doing
it
for
it
rather
than
doing
software
programming.
80
(
when
you
build
stuff
for
it
,
it
doe
n't
(
some
say
should
n't
)
have
to
be
pretty
just
functional.
in
other
word
,
this
is
n't
the
dogfood
we
wake
it
's
just
the
dog
food
we
have
to
eat.
we
started
talking
about
it
and
decided
that
the
'mail
form
'
would
give
u
exactly
what
we
are
looking
for.
1.a
very
different
look
to
let
the
user
know
that
the
gun
is
loaded
and
aimed.
2.the
ability
to
change/add
text
to
the
email.
3.send
a
copy
to
themselves
or
not.
4.can
be
coded
quickly
.
