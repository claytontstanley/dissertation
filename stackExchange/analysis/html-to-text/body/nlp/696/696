i
've
got
an
upcoming
project
wherein
i
will
need
to
connect
our
website
(
php5/apache
1.3/openbsd
4.1
)
to
our
back-end
system
running
on
a
iseries
with
os400
v5r3
so
that
i
can
access
some
table
stored
there.
i
've
done
some
checking
around
but
am
running
into
some
roadblocks.
from
what
i
've
seen
the
db2
extension
and
db2
software
from
ibm
only
run
under
linux.
i
've
tried
compiling
the
extension
with
all
the
software
from
ibm
and
even
tried
their
precompiled
ibm_db2
extension
with
no
luck.
ibm
only
support
linux
so
i
turned
on
the
linux
emulation
in
the
kernel
but
that
did
n't
seem
to
help
anything.
if
anyone
ha
run
across
getting
everything
to
run
natively
under
openbsd
that
would
be
great
,
but
what
i
think
i
may
have
to
do
is
setting
up
a
second
server
running
centos
with
db2
installed
(
most
likely
via
zendcore
for
ibm
since
it
seems
to
do
all
this
for
me
)
and
the
driver
so
that
i
can
set
up
a
small
transaction
server
that
i
can
post
against
and
get
a
json
representation
of
the
db2
data
that
i
need.
does
the
second
option
seem
overkill
or
doe
anyone
else
have
any
better
idea
?
