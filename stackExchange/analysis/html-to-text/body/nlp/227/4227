i
'm
using
a
dictionary
<
string
,
int
>
where
the
int
is
a
count
of
the
key.
now
,
i
need
to
access
the
last-inserted
key
inside
the
dictionary
,
but
i
do
not
know
the
name
of
it.
the
obvious
attempt
:
int
lastcount
=
mydict
[
mydict.keys
[
mydict.keys.count
]
]
;
doe
not
work
,
because
dictionary.keys
doe
not
implement
a
[
]
-indexer.
i
just
wonder
if
there
is
any
similar
class
?
i
thought
about
using
a
stack
,
but
that
only
store
a
string.
i
could
now
create
my
own
struct
and
then
use
a
stack
<
mystruct
>
,
but
i
wonder
if
there
is
another
alternative
,
essentially
a
dictionary
that
implement
an
[
]
-indexer
on
the
keys
?
