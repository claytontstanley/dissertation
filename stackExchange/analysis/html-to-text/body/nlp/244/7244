what
i
want
to
do
is
something
like
this
:
i
have
enums
with
combined
flagged
values.
public
static
class
enumextension
{
public
static
bool
isset
<
t
>
(
this
t
input
,
t
matchto
)
where
t
:
enum
//the
constraint
i
want
that
doe
n't
exist
in
c
#
3
{
return
(
input
&
matchto
)
!
=
0
;
}
}
so
then
i
could
do
:
myenum
tester
=
myenum.flaga
|
myenum.flagb
if
(
tester.isset
(
myenum.flaga
)
)
//act
on
flag
a
unfortunately
c
#
's
generic
where
constraint
have
no
enum
restriction
,
only
class
and
struct.
c
#
doe
n't
see
enums
a
structs
(
even
though
they
are
value
type
)
so
i
ca
n't
add
extension
type
like
this.
anyone
know
a
workaround
?
