what
is
the
best
way
to
go
about
calling
a
function
given
a
string
with
the
function
's
name
in
a
python
program
.
for
example
,
let
's
say
that
i
have
a
module
foo
,
and
i
have
a
string
whose
content
are
``
bar
''
.
what
is
the
best
way
to
go
about
calling
foo.bar
(
)
?
i
need
to
get
the
return
value
of
the
function
,
which
is
why
i
do
n't
just
use
eval
.
i
figured
out
how
to
do
it
by
using
eval
to
define
a
temp
function
that
return
the
result
of
that
function
call
,
but
i
'm
hoping
that
there
is
a
more
elegant
way
to
do
this
.
