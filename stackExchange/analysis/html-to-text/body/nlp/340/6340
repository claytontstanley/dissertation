i
've
got
a
table
that
is
supposed
to
track
day
and
cost
for
shipping
product
from
one
vendor
to
another
.
we
(
brilliantly
:
p
)
stored
both
the
shipping
vendor
(
fedex
,
ups
)
with
the
product
handling
vendor
(
think
...
dunder
mifflin
)
in
a
``
vendor
''
table
.
so
,
i
have
three
column
in
my
shipping_details
table
that
all
reference
vendor.no
.
for
some
reason
mysql
is
n't
letting
me
define
all
three
a
foreign
key
.
any
idea
?
