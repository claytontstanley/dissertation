i
inherited
a
windows
forms
app
written
in
vb.net
.
certain
part
of
the
app
run
dreadfully
slow
.
what
's
the
easiest
way
to
find
which
part
of
the
code
are
holding
thing
up
?
i
'm
looking
for
a
way
to
quickly
find
the
slowest
subroutine
and
tackle
them
first
in
an
attempt
to
speed
up
the
app
.
i
know
that
there
are
several
code
profiler
product
available
for
purchase
which
will
show
how
long
each
subroutine
take
,
but
i
wa
hoping
to
find
a
free
solution
.
