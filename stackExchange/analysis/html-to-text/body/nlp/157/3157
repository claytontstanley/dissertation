in
an
application
that
heavily
relies
on
.htaccess
rewriterules
for
it
prettyurls
(
cakephp
in
my
case
)
,
how
do
i
correctly
set
up
directive
to
exclude
certain
directory
from
this
rewriting
?
i.e.
:
/approot/.htaccess
app/
static/
by
default
every
request
to
/approot/*
is
being
rewritten
to
be
picked
up
by
app/webroot/index.php
,
where
it
's
being
analysed
and
corresponding
controller
action
are
being
invoked.
this
is
done
by
these
directive
in
.htaccess
:
rewritebase
/approot
rewriterule
^
$
app/webroot/
[
l
]
rewriterule
(
.*
)
app/webroot/
$
1
[
l
]
i
now
want
to
exclude
a
few
directory
like
static/
from
this
rewriting.
i
tried
with
this
before
the
cake
rewriterules
:
rewritecond
$
1
^
(
static|otherdir
)
.*
$
[
nc
]
rewriterule
(
.*
)
-
[
l
]
it
work
in
so
far
that
request
are
no
longer
rewritten
,
but
now
all
request
are
being
skipped
,
even
legitimate
cake
request
which
should
not
match
^
(
static|otherdir
)
.*
$
.
i
tried
several
variation
of
these
rule
but
ca
n't
get
it
to
work
the
way
i
want
.
