i
plan
to
be
storing
all
my
config
setting
in
my
application
's
app.config
section
(
using
the
configurationmanager.appsettings
class
)
.
as
the
user
change
setting
using
the
app
's
ui
(
clicking
checkboxes
,
choosing
radio
button
,
etc
.
)
,
i
plan
to
be
writing
those
change
out
to
the
appsettings
.
at
the
same
time
,
while
the
program
is
running
i
plan
to
be
accessing
the
appsettings
constantly
from
a
process
that
will
be
constantly
processing
data
.
changes
to
setting
via
the
ui
need
to
affect
the
data
processing
in
real-time
,
which
is
why
the
process
will
be
accessing
the
appsettings
constantly
.
is
this
a
good
idea
with
regard
to
performance
?
using
appsettings
is
supposed
to
be
``
the
right
way
''
to
store
and
access
configuration
setting
when
writing
.net
apps
,
but
i
worry
that
this
method
wa
n't
intended
for
a
constant
load
(
at
least
in
term
of
setting
being
constantly
read
)
.
if
anyone
ha
experience
with
this
,
i
would
greatly
appreciate
the
input
.
update
:
i
should
probably
clarify
a
few
point
.
this
is
not
a
web
application
,
so
connecting
a
database
to
the
application
might
be
overkill
simply
for
storing
configuration
setting
.
this
is
a
windows
forms
application
.
according
to
the
msdn
documention
,
the
configurationmanager
is
for
storing
not
just
application
level
setting
,
but
user
setting
a
well
.
(
especially
important
if
,
for
instance
,
the
application
is
installed
a
a
partial-trust
application
.
)
update
2
:
i
accepted
lomaxx
's
answer
because
properties
doe
indeed
look
like
a
good
solution
,
without
having
to
add
any
additional
layer
to
my
application
(
such
a
a
database
)
.
when
using
properties
,
it
already
doe
all
the
caching
that
others
suggested
.
this
mean
any
change
and
subsequent
read
are
all
done
in
memory
,
making
it
extremely
fast
.
properties
only
writes
the
change
to
disk
when
you
explicitly
tell
it
to
.
this
mean
i
can
make
change
to
the
config
setting
on-the-fly
at
run
time
and
then
only
do
a
final
save
out
to
disk
when
the
program
exit
.
just
to
verify
it
would
actually
be
able
to
handle
the
load
i
need
,
i
did
some
testing
on
my
laptop
and
wa
able
to
do
750,000
read
and
7,500
writes
per
second
using
properties
.
that
is
so
far
above
and
beyond
what
my
application
will
ever
even
come
close
to
needing
that
i
feel
quite
safe
in
using
properties
without
impacting
performance
.
thank
you
,
everyone
,
for
your
helpful
answer
.
