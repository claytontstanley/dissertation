what
is
the
best
way
to
verify/test
that
a
text
string
is
serialized
to
a
byte
array
with
a
certain
encoding
?
in
my
case
,
i
want
to
verify
that
an
xml
structure
is
serialized
to
a
byte
array
with
the
utf-8
encoding
which
is
of
variable
character
length
.
as
an
example
,
my
current
ugly
procedure
is
to
inject
a
character
known
to
require
two
byte
into
the
structure
before
serializing
,
then
replacing
the
two-byte
character
with
an
ascii
character
and
comparing
the
serialized
array
length
.
this
should
yield
two
serialized
array
where
the
array
containing
the
two-byte
character
should
have
length
+1
.
plus
if
the
solution
is
elegant
for
java
.
i
ca
n't
think
of
any
elegant
way
to
seek
for
a
byte
sequence
in
a
byte
array
.
(
could
be
used
to
seek
for
a
known
byte
sequence
representing
the
desired
character
representation
in
utf-8
.
)
