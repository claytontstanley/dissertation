there
are
a
few
way
to
get
class-like
behaviour
in
javascript
,
the
most
common
seem
to
be
prototype
based
like
this
:
function
vector
(
x
,
y
,
x
)
{
this.x
=
x
;
this.y
=
y
;
this.z
=
z
;
return
this
;
}
vector.prototype.length
=
function
(
)
{
return
math.sqrt
(
this.x
*
this.x
...
)
;
}
and
closure
based
approach
similar
to
function
vector
(
x
,
y
,
z
)
{
this.length
=
function
(
)
{
return
math.sqrt
(
x
*
x
+
...
)
;
}
}
for
various
reason
the
latter
is
faster
,
but
i
've
seen
(
and
i
frequently
do
write
)
the
prototype
version
and
wa
curious
a
to
what
other
people
do
.
