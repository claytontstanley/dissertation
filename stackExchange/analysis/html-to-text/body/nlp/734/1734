i
wa
just
looking
through
some
information
about
google
's
protocol
buffer
data
interchange
format
.
has
anyone
played
around
with
the
code
or
even
created
a
project
around
it
?
i
'm
currently
using
xml
in
a
python
project
for
structured
content
created
by
hand
in
a
text
editor
,
and
i
wa
wondering
what
the
general
opinion
wa
on
protocol
buffers
a
a
user-facing
input
format
.
the
speed
and
brevity
benefit
definitely
seem
to
be
there
,
but
there
are
so
many
factor
when
it
come
to
actually
generating
and
processing
the
data
.
