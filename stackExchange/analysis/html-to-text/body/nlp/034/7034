hi.
i
have
a
data
structure
that
represents
a
directed
graph
,
and
i
want
to
render
that
dynamically
on
an
html
page.
does
anyone
know
of
any
javascript
code
that
can
do
a
reasonable
job
with
graph
layout
?
these
graph
will
usually
be
just
a
few
node
,
maybe
ten
at
the
very
upper
end
,
so
my
guess
is
that
performance
is
n't
going
to
be
a
big
deal.
ideally
,
i
'd
like
to
be
able
to
hook
it
in
with
jquery
so
that
user
can
tweak
the
layout
manually
by
dragging
the
node
around.
edit
:
google
's
visualization
api
seems
to
be
more
``
graph
a
chart
''
oriented
than
``
graph
a
node
''
oriented.
i
did
n't
see
any
node-oriented
visualization
already
built
there
,
anyway.
do
you
know
that
one
exists
?
