i
am
writing
an
application
in
java
for
the
desktop
using
the
eclipse
swt
library
for
gui
rendering.
i
think
swt
help
java
get
over
the
biggest
hurdle
for
acceptance
on
the
desktop
:
namely
providing
a
java
application
with
a
consistent
,
responsive
interface
that
look
like
that
belonging
to
any
other
app
on
your
desktop.
however
,
i
feel
that
packaging
an
application
is
still
an
issue.
os
x
natively
provides
an
easy
mechanism
for
wrapping
java
apps
in
native
application
bundle
,
but
producing
an
app
for
windows/linux
that
doe
n't
require
the
user
to
run
an
ugly
batch
file
or
click
on
a
.jar
is
still
a
hassle.
possibly
that
's
not
such
an
issue
on
linux
,
where
the
user
is
likely
to
be
a
little
more
tech-savvy
,
but
on
windows
i
'd
like
to
have
a
regular
.exe
for
him/her
to
run.
has
anyone
had
any
experience
with
any
of
the
.exe
generation
tool
for
java
that
are
out
there
?
i
've
tried
jsmooth
but
had
various
issue
with
it.
is
there
a
better
solution
before
i
crack
out
visual
studio
and
roll
my
own
?
edit
:
i
should
perhaps
mention
that
i
am
unable
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
a
commercial
solution
.
