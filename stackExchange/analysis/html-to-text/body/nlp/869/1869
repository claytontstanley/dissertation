on
the
project
that
i
am
working
on
i
have
a
couple
of
database
.
each
table
and
each
column
in
the
database
ha
a
description
set
(
a
an
extended
property
in
sql
2005
)
.
as
a
part
of
the
documentation
going
to
the
client
we
need
to
produce
a
data
dictionary
showing
all
of
the
table
and
column
along
with
a
collection
of
meta
data
(
data-type
,
optionality
,
constraint
)
.
is
anyone
using
a
tool
to
automatically
create
this
kind
of
document
?
if
so
,
which
tool
do
you
use
?
i
have
used
data
dictionary
creator
which
is
awesome
but
it
doe
n't
seem
to
do
data
type
or
optionality
(
unless
you
want
to
add
in
custom
field
and
fill
them
in
yourself
)
.
