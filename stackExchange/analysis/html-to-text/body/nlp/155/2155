the
web
application
i
develop
often
require
co-dependant
configuration
setting
and
there
are
also
setting
that
have
to
change
a
we
move
between
each
of
our
environment
.
all
our
setting
are
currently
simple
key
value
pair
but
it
would
be
useful
to
create
custom
config
section
so
that
it
is
obvious
when
two
value
need
to
change
together
or
when
the
setting
need
to
change
for
an
environment
.
what
's
the
best
way
to
create
custom
config
section
and
are
there
any
special
consideration
to
make
when
retrieving
the
value
?
