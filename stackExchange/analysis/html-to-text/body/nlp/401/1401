i
have
a
custom
validation
function
in
javascript
in
a
user
control
on
a
.net
2.0
web
site
which
check
to
see
that
the
fee
paid
is
not
in
excess
of
the
fee
amount
due
.
i
've
placed
the
validator
code
in
the
ascx
file
,
and
i
have
also
tried
using
page.clientscript.registerclientscriptblock
(
)
and
in
both
case
the
validation
fire
,
but
can
not
find
the
javascript
function
.
the
output
in
firefox
's
error
console
is
``
feeamountcheck
is
not
defined
''
.
here
is
the
function
(
this
wa
taken
directly
from
firefox-
>
view
source
)
<
script
type=
''
text/javascript
''
>
function
feeamountcheck
(
source
,
argument
)
{
var
amountdue
=
document.getelementbyid
(
'ctl00_footercontentholder_fees1_feedue
'
)
;
var
amountpaid
=
document.getelementbyid
(
'ctl00_footercontentholder_fees1_feepaid
'
)
;
if
(
amountdue.value
>
0
&
&
amountdue
>
=
amountpaid
)
{
arguments.isvalid
=
true
;
}
else
{
arguments.isvalid
=
false
;
}
return
argument
;
}
any
idea
a
to
why
the
function
is
n't
being
found
?
how
can
i
remedy
this
without
having
to
add
the
function
to
my
master
page
or
consuming
page
?
thanks
in
advance
.
