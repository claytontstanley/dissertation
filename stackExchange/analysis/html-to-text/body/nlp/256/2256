is
there
a
way
of
mapping
data
collected
on
a
stream
or
array
to
a
data
structure
or
vice-versa
?
in
c++
this
would
simply
be
a
matter
of
casting
a
pointer
to
the
stream
a
a
data
type
i
want
to
use
(
or
vice-versa
for
the
reverse
)
eg
:
in
c++
mystruct
*
pmystrct
=
(
mystruct*
)
&
somedatastream
;
pmystrct-
>
item1
=
25
;
int
ireaddata
=
pmystrct-
>
item2
;
obviously
the
c++
way
is
pretty
unsafe
unless
you
are
sure
of
the
quality
of
the
stream
data
when
reading
incoming
data
,
but
for
outgoing
data
is
super
quick
and
easy.
strange
...

the
given
solution
were
helpful
,
the
accepted
answer
is
the
one
i
wa
looking
for
