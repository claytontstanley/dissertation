before
reading
anything
else
,
please
take
time
to
read
the
original
thread.
a
quick
simple
overview
:
a
.xfdl
file
is
a
is
a
gzipped
.xml
file
which
ha
then
been
encoded
in
base64.
i
wish
to
de-encode
the
.xfdl
into
xml
which
i
can
then
modify
and
then
re-encode
back
into
a
.xfdl
file.

i
have
been
able
to
take
a
.xfdl
file
and
de-encode
it
from
base64
using
uudeview
:
uudeview
-i
yourform.xfdl
then
decommpressed
it
using
gunzip
gunzip
-s
``
''
<
unknown.001
>
yourform-unpacked.xml
the
xml
produced
is
100
%
readable
and
look
wonderful.
without
modifying
the
xml
then
,
i
should
be
able
to
re-compress
it
using
gzip
:
gzip
yourform-unpacked.xml
then
re-encoded
in
base-64
:
base64
-e
yourform-unpacked.xml.gz
yourform_reencoded.xfdl
if
my
thinking
is
correct
,
the
original
file
and
the
re-encoded
file
should
be
equal.
if
i
put
yourform.xfdl
and
yourform_reencoded.xfdl
into
beyond
compare
,
however
,
they
do
not
match
up.
also
,
the
original
file
can
be
viewed
in
an
.xfdl
viewer.
the
viewer
say
that
the
re-encoded
xfdl
is
unreadable.
i
have
also
tried
uuenview
to
re-encode
in
base64
,
it
also
produce
the
same
results.
any
help
would
be
appreciated.
if
you
want
to
try
it
