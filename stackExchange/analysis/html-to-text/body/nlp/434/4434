let
's
say
that
there
is
a
solution
that
contains
two
project
(
project1
and
project2
)
.
project1
is
set
a
a
startup
project
(
it
name
is
displayed
in
a
bold
font
)
.
i
double-click
some
file
in
project2
to
open
it.
the
file
open
,
but
something
else
happens
too
-
project2
get
set
a
a
startup
project.
i
tried
to
find
an
option
in
configuration
to
change
it
,
but
i
found
none.
can
this
feature
(
though
it
's
more
like
a
bug
to
me
)
be
disabled
?
