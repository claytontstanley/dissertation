i
wa
just
wandering
if
there
is
an
elegant
way
to
set
the
maximum
cpu
load
for
a
particular
thread
doing
intensive
calculation
.
right
now
i
have
located
the
most
time
consuming
loop
in
the
thread
(
it
doe
only
compression
)
and
use
gettickcount
(
)
and
sleep
(
)
with
hardcoded
value
.
it
make
sure
that
the
loop
continues
for
a
certain
period
of
time
and
than
sleep
for
a
certain
minimal
time
.
it
more
or
le
doe
the
job
i.e
.
guarantee
that
the
thread
will
not
use
more
than
50
%
of
cpu
.
however
behavior
is
dependent
on
the
number
of
cpu
core
(
huge
disadvantage
)
and
simply
ugly
(
smaller
disadvantage
:
)
)
.
any
idea
?
