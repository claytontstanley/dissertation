i
had
an
php
script
to
update
the
webserver
from
a
local
directory.
i
'm
migrating
the
script
into
python
,
it
work
almost
ok
but
after
a
put
command
the
size
of
the
file
in
the
server
is
n't
the
same
a
the
local
file.
once
i
download
again
the
file
from
the
ftp
server
,
the
only
difference
is
the
cr/lf
mark.
it
annoys
me
because
the
same
script
is
comparing
the
size
of
the
file
to
update.
also
,
it
work
perfectly
in
php
v√≠a
ftp_put.
from
ftplib
import
ftp
ftpserver
=
``

try

except
