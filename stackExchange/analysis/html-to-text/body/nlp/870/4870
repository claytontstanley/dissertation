i
'm
writing
a
telnet
client
of
sort
in
c
#
and
part
of
what
i
have
to
parse
are
ansi/vt100
escape
sequence
,
specifically
,
just
those
used
for
colour
and
formatting
(
detailed
here
)
.
one
method
i
have
is
one
to
find
all
the
code
and
remove
them
,
so
i
can
render
the
text
without
any
formatting
if
needed
:
public
static
string
stripstringformating
(
string
formattedstring
)
{
if
(
rtest.ismatch
(
formattedstring
)
)
return
rtest.replace
(
formattedstring
,
string.empty
)
;
else
return
formattedstring
;
}
i
'm
new
to
regular
expression
and
i
wa
suggested
to
use
this
:
static
regex
rtext
=
new
regex
(
@
''
\e\
[
[
\d
;
]
+m
''
,
regexoptions.compiled
)
;
however
,
this
failed
if
the
escape
code
wa
incomplete
due
to
an
error
on
the
server.
so
then
this
wa
suggested
,
but
my
friend
warned
it
might
be
slower
(
this
one
also
match
another
condition
(
z
)
that
i
might
come
across
later
)
:
static
regex
rtest
=
new
regex
(
@
''
(
\e
(
\
[
(
[
\d
;
]
*
[
mz
]
?
)
)
?
)
?
''
,
regexoptions.compiled
)
;
this
not
only
worked
,
but
wa
in
fact
faster
to
and
reduced
the
impact
on
my
text
rendering.
can
someone
explain
to
a
regexp
newbie
,
why
?
