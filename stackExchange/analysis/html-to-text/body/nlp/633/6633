i
have
inherited
some
legacy
php
code
what
wa
written
back
when
it
wa
standard
practice
to
use
register_globals.
we
know
now
that
it
is
bad
for
security
to
have
it
enabled.
the
problem
is
how
do
i
find
all
the
place
in
the
code
where
i
need
to
use
$
_get
or
$
_post
?
my
only
thought
wa
to
set
the
error
reporting
to
warn
about
uninitialized
variable
and
then
test
each
part
of
the
site.
is
there
an
easier
way
?
will
i
have
to
test
each
code
path
in
the
site
or
will
php
give
a
warning
on
a
file
basis
?
