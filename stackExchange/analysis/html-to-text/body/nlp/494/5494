i
'm
using
iis
in
windows
2003
server
for
a
sharepoint
intranet
.
external
incoming
request
will
be
using
the
host
header
portal.mycompany.com
and
be
forced
to
use
ssl
.
i
wa
wondering
if
there
's
a
way
to
set
up
an
alternate
host
header
such
a
<
http
:
//internalportal/
>
which
only
accepts
request
from
the
internal
network
,
but
doe
n't
force
the
user
to
use
ssl
.
any
recommendation
for
how
to
set
this
up
?
