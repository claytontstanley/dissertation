i
have
n't
seen
any
question
relating
to
gnu
autoconf/automake
build
,
but
i
'm
hoping
at
least
some
of
you
out
there
are
familiar
with
it.
here
go
:
i
have
a
project
(
i
'll
call
it
myproject
)
that
includes
another
project
(
vendor
)
.
the
vendor
project
is
a
standalone
project
maintained
by
someone
else.
including
a
project
like
this
is
fairly
straightforward
,
but
in
this
case
there
is
a
tiny
snag
:
each
project
generates
it
own
config.h
file
,
each
of
which
defines
standard
macro
such
a
package
,
version
,
etc.
this
mean
that
,
during
the
build
,
when
vendor
is
being
built
,
i
get
lot
of
error
like
this
:
...
warning
:
``
version
''
redefined
...
warning
:
this
is
the
location
of
the
previous
definition
...
warning
:
``
package
''
redefined
...
warning
:
this
is
the
location
of
the
previous
definition
these
are
just
warning
,
for
the
time
being
at
least
,
but
i
would
like
to
get
rid
of
them.
the
only
relevant
information
i
've
been
able
to
turn
up
with
a
google
search
is
this
thread
on
the
automake
mailing
list
,
which
is
n't
a
whole
lot
of
help.
does
anybody
else
have
any
better
idea
?
