i
've
got
a
menu
in
python
.
that
part
wa
easy
.
i
'm
using
raw_input
(
)
to
get
the
selection
from
the
user
.
the
problem
is
that
raw_input
(
and
input
)
require
the
user
to
press
enter
after
they
make
a
selection
.
is
there
any
way
to
make
the
program
act
immediately
upon
a
keystroke
?
here
's
what
i
've
got
so
far
:
import
sys
print
``
''
''
menu
1
)
say
foo
2
)
say
bar
''
''
''
answer
=
raw_input
(
``
make
a
selection
>
``
)
if
``
1
''
in
answer
:
print
``
foo
''
elif
``
2
''
in
answer
:
print
``
bar
''
it
would
be
great
to
have
something
like
print
menu
while
lastkey
=
``
''
:
lastkey
=
check_for_recent_keystrokes
(
)
if
``
1
''
in
lastkey
:
#
do
stuff
...
