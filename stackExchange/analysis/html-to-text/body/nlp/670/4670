so
i
want
to
get
a
project
on
a
distributed
version
control
system
,
such
a
mercurial
,
git
,
or
bazaar.
the
catch
is
that
i
need
the
windows
support
to
be
good
,
i.e.
no
instruction
that
start
off
with
``
install
cygwin
...
''
.
now
i
've
heard
that
git
's
windows
support
is
decent
these
day
,
but
do
n't
have
any
first
hand
experience.
also
,
it
sound
like
the
bazaar
team
ha
an
explicit
goal
of
making
it
a
multiplatform
a
possible.
can
i
get
any
recommendation
?
