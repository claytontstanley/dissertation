one
of
the
topic
that
seems
to
come
up
regularly
on
mailing
list
and
online
discussion
is
the
merit
(
or
lack
thereof
)
of
doing
a
computer
science
degree.
an
argument
that
seems
to
come
up
time
and
again
for
the
negative
party
is
that
they
have
been
coding
for
some
number
of
year
and
they
have
never
used
recursion.
so
the
question
is
:
what
is
recursion
?
when
would
i
use
recursion
?
why
do
n't
people
use
recursion
?
