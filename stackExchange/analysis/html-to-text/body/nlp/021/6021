i
have
a
billion
potential
idea
running
through
my
head.
about
five
of
those
i
have
actually
started
and
have
become
``
side
project
''
in
addition
to
my
``
day
job
''
.
some
are
further
along
than
others
,
and
a
few
are
even
demonstrable.
the
problem
i
have
is
that
one
always
take
attention
away
from
the
others.
i
do
n't
want
to
give
up
any
of
them
,
so
the
result
is
that
none
of
them
are
finished.
should
i
just
pick
the
project
with
the
most
potential
and
finish
it
?
then
how
do
i
support
it
when
i
want
to
start
something
new
?
at
what
point
should
i
form
a
``
team
''
instead
of
going
lone-wolf
?
should
i
just
quit
and
accept
the
fact
that
all
my
idea
ca
n't
succeed
?
is
there
a
(
free
)
tool
that
will
help
me
prioritize
my
project
and
idea
,
give
me
an
overview
of
the
status
of
each
,
and
help
me
form
a
resonable
time-table
?
