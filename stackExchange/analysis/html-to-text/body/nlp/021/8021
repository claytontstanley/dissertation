i
'd
like
to
allow
a
user
to
set
up
an
ssh
tunnel
to
a
particular
machine
on
a
particular
port
(
say
,
5000
)
,
but
i
want
to
restrict
this
user
a
much
a
possible
.
(
authentication
will
be
with
public/private
keypair
)
.
i
know
i
need
to
edit
the
relevant
~/.ssh/authorized_keys
file
,
but
i
'm
not
sure
exactly
what
content
to
put
in
there
(
other
than
the
public
key
)
.
