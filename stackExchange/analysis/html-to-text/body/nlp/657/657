what
is
the
fastest
,
yet
secure
way
to
encrypt
password
in
(
php
prefered
)
,
and
for
which
ever
method
you
choose
is
it
portable
?
in
other
word
if
i
later
migrate
my
website
to
a
different
server

my
password
continue
to
work
?
the
method
i
am
using
now
i
wa
told
is
dependent
on
the
exact
version
of
the
library
installed
on
the
server
