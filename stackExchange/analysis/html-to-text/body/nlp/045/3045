problem
:
i
have
two
spreadsheet
that
each
serve
different
purpose
but
contain
one
particular
piece
of
data
that
need
to
be
the
same
in
both
spreadsheets.
this
piece
of
data
(
one
of
the
column
)
get
updated
in
spreadsheet
a
but
need
to
also
be
updated
in
spreadsheet
b.
goal
:
a
solution
that
would
somehow
link
these
two
spreadsheet
together
(
keep
in
mind
that
they
exist
on
two
separate
lan
share
on
the
network
)
so
that
when
a
is
updated
,
b
is
automatically
updated
for
the
corresponding
record.
*note
that
i
understand
fully
that
a
database
would
probably
be
a
better
plan
for
task
such
a
these
but
unfortunately
i
have
no
say
in
that
matter.
**note
also
that
this
need
to
work
for
office
2003
and
office
2007
