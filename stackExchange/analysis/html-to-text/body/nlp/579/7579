in
the
ssw
rule
to
better
sql
server
database
there
is
an
example
of
a
full
database
maintenance
plan
:
ssw
.
in
the
example
they
run
both
a
reorganize
index
and
then
a
rebuild
index
and
then
update
statistics.
is
there
any
point
to
this
?
i
thought
reorganize
index
wa
a
fast
but
le
effective
version
of
rebuild
index
?
and
that
an
index
rebuild
would
also
update
the
statistic
automatically
(
on
the
clustered
index
at
least
)
.
