i
have
a
company
that
would
like
to
bring
me
in
to
serve
me
an
hour
long
exam
.
no
resource
other
than
a
pencil
and
paper
.
i
really
could
n't
get
any
sort
of
feedback
on
the
type
of
exam
(
implementation
or
generic
)
beside
that
it
would
test
a
few
specific
area
.
have
you
done
anything
like
this
?
what
sort
of
question
did
they
ask
?
what
's
a
good
way
to
prepare
?
i
'll
probably
go
in
a
couple
week
before
school
start
back
up
.
a
time
sensitive
exam
structure
is
a
weak
point
for
me
,
so
what
should
i
absolutely
focus
down
on
?
if
they
like
the
exam
,
that
's
when
i
'll
get
a
face-to-face
meeting
.
an
advance
thanks
go
to
everybody
who
provide
their
time
.
