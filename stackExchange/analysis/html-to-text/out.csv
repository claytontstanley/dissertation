"19","Solutions welcome in any language. :-) I'm looking for the fastest way to obtain the value of pi, as a personal challenge. More specifically I'm using ways that don't involve using #defined constants like M_PI, or hard-coding the number in.
The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable; I've included it as a baseline to compare the other versions against. In my tests, with built-ins, the 4 * atan(1) version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the atan(1) into a constant. With -fno-builtin specified, the atan2(0, -1) version is fastest.
Here's the main testing program (pitimes.c):
#include <math.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <time.h> #define ITERS 10000000 #define TESTWITH(x) {                                                       \     diff = 0.0;                                                             \     time1 = clock();                                                        \     for (i = 0; i < ITERS; ++i)                                             \         diff += (x) - M_PI;                                                 \     time2 = clock();                                                        \     printf(""%s\t=> %e, time => %f\n"", #x, diff, diffclock(time2, time1));   \ }  static inline double diffclock(clock_t time1, clock_t time0) {     return (double) (time1 - time0) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC; }  int main() {     int i;     clock_t time1, time2;     double diff;      /* Warmup. The atan2 case catches GCC's atan folding (which would      * optimise the ``4 * atan(1) - M_PI'' to a no-op), if -fno-builtin      * is not used. */     TESTWITH(4 * atan(1))     TESTWITH(4 * atan2(1, 1))  #if defined(__GNUC__) && (defined(__i386__) || defined(__amd64__))     extern double fldpi();     TESTWITH(fldpi()) #endif      /* Actual tests start here. */     TESTWITH(atan2(0, -1))     TESTWITH(acos(-1))     TESTWITH(2 * asin(1))     TESTWITH(4 * atan2(1, 1))     TESTWITH(4 * atan(1))      return 0; }
And the inline assembly stuff (fldpi.c), noting that it will only work for x86 and x64 systems:
double fldpi() {     double pi;     asm(""fldpi"" : ""=t"" (pi));     return pi; }
And a build script that builds all the configurations I'm testing (build.sh):
#!/bin/sh gcc -O3 -Wall -c           -m32 -o fldpi-32.o fldpi.c gcc -O3 -Wall -c           -m64 -o fldpi-64.o fldpi.c  gcc -O3 -Wall -ffast-math  -m32 -o pitimes1-32 pitimes.c fldpi-32.o gcc -O3 -Wall              -m32 -o pitimes2-32 pitimes.c fldpi-32.o -lm gcc -O3 -Wall -fno-builtin -m32 -o pitimes3-32 pitimes.c fldpi-32.o -lm gcc -O3 -Wall -ffast-math  -m64 -o pitimes1-64 pitimes.c fldpi-64.o -lm gcc -O3 -Wall              -m64 -o pitimes2-64 pitimes.c fldpi-64.o -lm gcc -O3 -Wall -fno-builtin -m64 -o pitimes3-64 pitimes.c fldpi-64.o -lm
Apart from testing between various compiler flags (I've compared 32-bit against 64-bit too, because the optimisations are different), I've also tried switching the order of the tests around. The atan2(0, -1) version still comes out top every time, though.
I'm keen to hear what results you have, as well as improvements to the testing process. :-)

This, coupled with QueryPerformanceFrequency() giving a constant 1000000 as the frequency works well on my machine, giving me a 64 bit variable that contains uSeconds since the program's start up. So is this portable? I don't want to discover it works differently if the kernel was compiled in a certain way or anything like that. I am fine with it being non-portable to something other than Linux, however.

"109","Recently our site has been deluged with the resurgence of the ASPRox bot SQL Injection attack. Without going into details, the attack attempts to execute SQL code by encoding the T-SQL commands in an ASCII encoded BINARY string. It looks something like this:

I know that from outside of the object you should use a getter/setter, but from within would you just do:
Java:
String property = this.property;
PHP:
$property = $this->property;
or would you do:
Java:
String property = this.getProperty();
PHP:
$property = $this->getProperty();
Forgive me if my Java is a little off, it's been a year since I programmed in Java...
EDIT:
It seems people are assuming I am talking about private or protected variables/properties only. When I learned OO I was taught to use getters/setters for every single property even if it was public (and actually I was told never to make any variable/property public). So, I may be starting off from a false assumption from the get go. It appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don't need getters and setters, which goes against what I was taught, and what I was talking about, although maybe that needs to be discussed as well. That's probably a good topic for a different question though...

"129","I've been banging my head against SQL Server 2005 trying to get a lot of data out.  I've been given a database with nearly 300 tables in it and I need to turn this into a MySQL database.  My first call was to use bcp but unfortunately it doesn't produce valid CSV - strings aren't encapsulated so you can't deal with any row that has a string with a comma in it (or whatever you use as a delimiter) and I would still have to hand write all of the create table statements as obviously CSV doesn't tell you anything about the data types.
What would be better is if there was some tool that could connect to both SQL Server and MySQL and then do a copy.  You lose views, stored procedures, trigger, etc. but it isn't hard to copy a table that only uses base types from one DB to another... is it?
Does anybody know of such a tool?  I don't mind how many assumptions it makes or what simplifications occur, as long as it supports integer, float, datetime and string.

"134","I have and pretty standard table setup in a current application using the .net XSD DataSet and TableAdapter features. My contracts table consists of some standard contract information, with a column for the primary department. This column is a foreign key to my Departments table, where I store the basic department name, id, notes. This is all setup and functioning in my SQL Server.
When I use the XSD tool, I can drag both tables in at once and it auto detects/creates the foreign key I have between these two tables. This works great when I'm on my main page and am viewing contract data.
However, when I go to my administrative page to modify the department data. I typically do something like this:
Dim dtDepartment As New DepartmentDataTable()
Dim taDepartment As New DepartmentTableAdapter()
taDepartment.Fill(dtDepartment)
However, at this point an exception is thrown saying to the effect that there is a foreign key reference broken here, I'm guessing since I don't have the Contract DataTable filled.
Has anybody encountered this before? I know I can simply remove the foreign key from the XSD to make things work fine, but having the additional integrity check there and having the XSD schema match the SQL schema in the database is nice.

The obvious flaw with that: 10.000 would be interpreted as 10. Another approach: if the string contains 2 different non-numeric characters, use the last one as the decimal separator and discard the others. If I only have one, check if it occurs more than once and discard it if it does. It it only appears once, check if it has 3 digits after it. If yes, discard it, otherwise use it as decimal separator.

"194","Yes, I know.  The existence of a running copy of SQL Server 6.5 in 2008 is absurd.
That stipulated, what is the best way to migrate from 6.5 to 2005?  Is there any direct path?  Most of the documentation I've found deals with upgrading 6.5 to 7.
Should I forget about the native SQL Server upgrade utilities, script out all of the objects and data, and try to recreate from scratch?
I was going to attempt the upgrade this weekend, but server issues pushed it back till next.  So, any ideas would be welcomed during the course of the week.
Update.  This is how I ended up doing it:
Back up the database in question and Master on 6.5.
Execute SQL Server 2000's instcat.sql against 6.5's Master.  This allows SQL Server 2000's OLEDB provider to connect to 6.5.
Use SQL Server 2000's standalone ""Import and Export Data"" to create a DTS package, using OLEDB to connect to 6.5.  This successfully copied all 6.5's tables to a new 2005 database (also using OLEDB).
Use 6.5's Enterprise Manager to script out all of the database's indexes and triggers to a .sql file.
Execute that .sql file against the new copy of the database, in 2005's Management Studio.
Use 6.5's Enterprise Manager to script out all of the stored procedures.
Execute that .sql file against the 2005 database.  Several dozen sprocs had issues making them incompatible with 2005.  Mainly non-ANSI joins and quoted identifier issues.
Corrected all of those issues and re-executed the .sql file.
Recreated the 6.5's logins in 2005 and gave them appropriate permissions.
There was a bit of rinse/repeat when correcting the stored procedures (there were hundreds of them to correct), but the upgrade went great otherwise.
Being able to use Management Studio instead of Query Analyzer and Enterprise Manager 6.5 is such an amazing difference.  A few report queries that took 20-30 seconds on the 6.5 database are now running in 1-2 seconds, without any modification, new indexes, or anything.  I didn't expect that kind of immediate improvement.

What I mean is that I essentially have an interface, ICard, which a card class implements (public class Card056 : ICard) and which contains function that are called by the game.
Now, to make the thing maintainable/moddable, I would like to have the class for each card as source code in the database and essentially compile it on first use. So when I have to add/change a card, I'll just add it to the database and tell my application to refresh, without needing any assembly deployment (especially since we would be talking about 1 assembly per card which means hundreds of assemblies).
Is that possible? Register a class from a source file and then instantiate it, etc.
ICard Cards[current] = new MyGame.CardLibrary.Card056(); Cards[current].OnEnterPlay(ref currentGameState);
The language is C#, but extra bonus if it's possible to write the script in any .NET language.

I work on some changes to a project that require new tables or columns in the database. I make the database modifications and continue my work. Usually, I remember to write down the changes so that they can be replicated on the live system. However, I don't always remember what I've changed and I don't always remember to write it down.
So, I make a push to the live system and get a big, obvious error that there is no NewColumnX. Ugh.

The book suggests that in a scenario like mine, a good solution would be to nest the workhorse classes inside the interface class, so there are no separate files for classes the client is not meant to use, and to avoid any possible naming conflicts? I don't know about these justifications. Nested classes are a new concept to me. Just want to see what programmers think about the issue.

"395","My company makes a monolithic piece of software that our customers use to run their car dealerships. The original app was written in VB6, and it has grown substantially over the last few years. Until now, there hasn't really been a business case for switching to the .net framework. Sure, it's newer, considerably better at certain things, and when used correctly speeds development time, but there's nothing we can't do in VB6 that we need to be able to do. Getting things done is harder in VB6, but almost nothing is impossible. Recently though, Microsoft dropped support for VB6, and it seems obvious to me that switching to a new platform is inevitable.
The way VB .net works and requires you to think is so fundamentally different (heck, even the way you pass variables into subs has changed), and as far as I can tell, switching to .net would require a complete re-design and re-write of the app.
My question(s): Have any of you been in this position? Of the tools available to smooth the transition, which ones work and which should be avoided? And how do I sell our customers and my boss on this? As the suits like to say, where's the ROI?

Developer checks the comments and makes changes (if appropriate)

"419","Part of my everyday work is maintaining and extending legacy VB6 applications. A common engine is written in C/C++ and VB6 uses these functions in order to improve performance.
When it comes to asynchronous programming, a C interface is not enough and we rely on COM controls to fire events to VB6.
My problem is that when I register the control in VB6, VB loads this control in memory and does not unload it until I quit the VB6 IDE. As the control is loaded the whole time, I am unable to recompile it in VC6, because the DLL file is locked.
A solution I found is not to enable the control in VB but use the CreateObject() with the full name of my control. The problem then is that I must declare my control as an Object because VB6 knows nothing of the interface I am using and I do not have access to IntelliSense, which is a pain.
Any idea how I can tell VB6 to unload controls after quitting the application? Or directly in the IDE?

"580","I wonder how you guys manage deployment of a database between 2 SQL Servers, specifically SQL Server 2005. Now, there is a development and a live one. As this should be part of a buildscript (standard windows batch, even do with current complexity of those scripts, i might switch to PowerShell or so later), Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count.
Would you just copy the .mdf File and attach it? I am always a bit careful when working with binary data, as this seems to be a compatiblity issue (even though development and live should run the same version of the server at all time).
Or - given the lack of ""EXPLAIN CREATE TABLE"" in T-SQL - do you do something that exports an existing database into SQL-Scripts which you can run on the target server? If yes, is there a tool that can automatically dump a given Database into SQL Queries and that runs off the command line? (Again, Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count).
And lastly - given the fact that the live database already contains data, the deployment may not involve creating all tables but rather checking the difference in structure and ALTER TABLE the live ones instead, which may also need data verification/conversion when existing fields change.
Now, i hear a lot of great stuff about the Red Gate products, but for hobby projects, the price is a bit steep.
So, what are you using to automatically deploy SQL Server Databases from Test to Live?

I know that I can enable dragging windows across edges to the next workspace, and the expose feature to drag windows between workspaces.  However, the drag and drop on the icon view is really powerful, and I would love to have it back along with all the great Compiz special effects.
